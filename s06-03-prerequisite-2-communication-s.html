        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p01">A successful job search is a match between what an employer wants and what a candidate wants. That match is made based on what is communicated. While an interview is structured a specific way, at its core it is a communication between job seeker and employer. While networking has its standards and rules of etiquette, at its core it is about communicating via listening, speaking, writing, and so forth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p02">The six-step process will give you the tactics that are particular to interviewing, networking, and other job search–specific communications, but the successful job seeker needs to have solid overall communication skills in place in the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_l01">

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p03">Communication occurs at every stage of the job search.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Skills Are a Proxy for Job Skills</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p01">You need communications skills for more than understanding and developing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rapport</a><span class="glossdef">Camaraderie, ease, familiarity. You have developed rapport with someone when they feel comfortable around you.</span></span> with prospective employers. You will also need communication skills on the job, so the way you communicate in your search is a sign of the way you might communicate on the job.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p02">Many employers also look at communication skills in general as a proxy for attention to detail. If you are sloppy with your job search communication—leaving rambling voice mails, sending e-mails with typos or grammatical mistakes—then you likely do this on the job. Why should employers assume you will be more careful after you get the job? If you don’t double-check your communication now, you probably won’t start once you are hired.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p03">Finally, your communication skills underscore your logic and reasoning. If your interview responses are scattered or unrelated, that could be a sign your thought process isn’t logical or structured. If you can’t get to the point in regular conversation, maybe you bring this disorganized reasoning to your work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Your Job Search Can Be Tailored to Showcase Your Communication Strengths and Support Your Weaknesses</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p01">Look at your history to see your current communication strengths and weaknesses, so you know where you need to focus as you prepare for a job search. If you know that you are better at written over verbal communication, you might choose e-mail over phone calls in situations that call for either approach (e.g., when you try to get a networking meeting). But you can’t avoid a method of communication entirely, so the verbally challenged should allot extra time to practice interviewing and perhaps take the time away from drafting cover letters, which play to their writing strength. For someone with more verbal than written strengths, they will structure their search differently—practicing different areas and budgeting more time in weak areas that may take longer to strengthen.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p02">If you have already selected job targets, incorporate the communication requirements for your target as you plan your job search process. Some fields, such as education, law, sales, consulting, and public relations, heavily emphasize communication, so each and every correspondence has extra weight. Your job search communication becomes a proxy for your potential communication on the job.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p03">The communication requirements may influence the structure of the process. For communication-focused fields, a presentation as part of the interview process may be required. For other fields that are not communication heavy, such as accounting or IT, you likely will not do a presentation (you may for senior roles, but not generally). Start brushing up on presentation skills now if your job search may specifically require this.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Improve Communication Skills with Deliberate Focus and Practice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_p01">Now you know the general ways communication skills enter the job search equation, as well as specific ways that different fields may use communication skills to evaluate potential job candidates. With the importance of communication skills in mind, you can deliberately focus and practice to improve your communication skills:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>Start the habit of editing all of your written communication, including e-mails, for correct spelling and grammar. Learn to use the spell check, dictionary, and other helpful functions in your word-processing and e-mail programs.</li>
            <li>Review proper business letter formats. We will review cover letters and thank-you letters later in this book, but general e-mails back and forth also need to be handled with proper care.</li>
            <li>Do an audit of your verbal communication style. Do you talk too fast? Do you enunciate? Are you able to get to the point concisely, or do you ramble? Do you stutter or sound nervous? Tape yourself or have a friend give you an objective critique of your verbal skills now, so you know what needs work.</li>
            <li>Practice delivering presentations. If you can take a class that has a presentation opportunity, that is a good option. You might also join a club or professional group where you have a chance to present.</li>
            <li>Practice <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active listening</a><span class="glossdef">Paying attention and absorbing what the other person is saying.</span></span>. In your daily conversations, become aware of how well you listen. Are you jumping to what you want to say? Could you paraphrase what the other person is saying?</li>
            <li>Practice listening in different scenarios. Do you listen well over the phone? Can you focus in a group and one on one? The job search involves many different situations, so your listening skills will be tested in many different ways.</li>
