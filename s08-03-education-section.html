            <li>Learn how to present your education to position you for success with your résumé reader.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p01">While you are in school, or up to one year after you graduate, your <em class="emphasis">education</em> section should appear before your <em class="emphasis">experience</em> section. Once you are a working professional, these two sections can and should be flipped.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p02">Additional items in this section include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_l02">
        <li>Expected graduation date: Listing the month or the season both work well here (e.g., Spring 2013 or May 2013).</li>
        <li>Relevant coursework: You may choose to list relevant coursework if it pertains to the position for which you are applying.</li>
        <li>Major and minor: You may choose to include both your major and your minor.</li>
        <li>GPA: You may include your overall GPA or you may decide to list the GPA of your major. It’s recommended that you not include your GPA if it is below 3.3. Certain industries are more concerned with GPA than others, including consulting, investment banking, and trading, which can require a 3.6 or 3.7 and above. It’s best to research each industry to better familiarize yourself with such requirements because this can vary by industry and by company.</li>
        <li>Extracurricular activities: Recruiters may be impressed to read that you were active in your college and that you belonged to targeted student clubs. If you held any leadership posts, that information should be included as well.</li>
        <li>Study abroad: If you have studied abroad, list that here. You should include the name of the university, the city and country, and the coursework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p03">Nontraditional college students (those who have significant work experience and then decide to obtain their degree) may want to list experience before education. Since this is unusual for a new graduate, you should consult with either career services or a career coach regarding this résumé order.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p04">Here is an example of how to list your education information.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p05">If you attended only one college, only that college should be listed in this section.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p06">If you transferred from another college, you should list both schools in this section. The first school you list is the current school you attend, followed by the previous school. If and when you attend graduate school, law school, and so forth, your postgraduate school would then be listed first.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p07">High schools, no matter how prestigious, should not be included in a résumé.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p08">If you’ve received additional training and certifications, this information does not belong in your education section. Instead, it can be listed in skills and additional information, which will be reviewed in the section of this chapter titled “Skills, Additional Information, and References.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p09">Using the preceding information, <a class="xref" href="#ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_f01">Figure 4.3 "Sample Résumé—Header, Objective, and Education"</a> illustrates what our résumé looks like thus far.</p>
