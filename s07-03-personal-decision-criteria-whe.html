        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Industry, function, and geography are helpful external criteria. When you look out into the market at the broad spectrum of jobs, having three elements to filter and narrow this down is critical. But you have other criteria important to you internally that are unrelated to a specific industry, function, or geography:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Employer size (global <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 company, small business)</li>
            <li>Employer history (start-up, established, either OK)</li>
            <li>Employer name recognition (household brand name, start-up)</li>
            <li>Compensation (minimum salary of $x, bonus, equity)</li>
            <li>Opportunity for advancement and growth (clear path of advancement, training)</li>
            <li>Lifestyle (reasonable and set hours, no travel)</li>
            <li>Flexibility (able to work from home, able to work compressed workweek)</li>
            <li>Job structure (lots of autonomy, lots of structure)</li>
            <li>Culture and colleagues (friendly, meritocratic)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Being clear about the three elements will help you research, but understanding your internal criteria will help you <em class="emphasis">select</em> your next job. From the preceding, you can see three broad categories to consider:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Compensation and Advancement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p01">Compensation has many elements. Opportunity for advancement can be categorized with compensation because it is directly tied to compensation elements:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Cash salary</li>

            <li>Other bonus (year-end, quarterly, performance)</li>
            <li>Profit sharing</li>
            <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Equity and stock options</a><span class="glossdef">Equity is ownership in a company. Stock options do not convey actual ownership in the company, but rather are representations of ownership, and the value of your options parallels the value of ownership.</span></span></li>
            <li>Health benefits</li>
            <li>Insurance</li>
            <li>Retirement plans and pension</li>
            <li>Tuition reimbursement</li>
            <li>Travel and expense reimbursement</li>
            <li>Perks (professional association membership, discounts)</li>
            <li>Size and speed of salary increases and promotion opportunities</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p02">Some elements are more standard for certain jobs than others. Nonprofit and government jobs typically do not have any bonus components. You will want to find out what is customary in the sector, industry, and function you are considering, if a specific element of compensation is high on your list of priorities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p03">The range of offerings varies greatly from company to company and even within companies. One company in the same industry and for the same functional role may pay more or less and have a different compensation structure than another company in the same industry and function. Even within companies, there is variation because your compensation depends on the level of the job you are filling, as well as the skills and experience you are bringing to the job. Some roles have a lot of built-in variability. For example, sales roles may have a small defined portion (base salary or draw) and then have bonuses or commissions based on achieving certain goals (e.g., selling $x amount).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s03_p04">Look at your needs and priorities. What are your financial obligations? If you have a lot of student loan or credit card debt, then lower-paying jobs may just be out of the question. If you have a spouse with health benefits that you can use, then maybe that part of the package doesn’t matter to you. If you are considering graduate school, then tuition reimbursement may be more attractive. Rank the compensation elements in the previous list, and know which are necessary versus nice to have versus of no interest. Compare your list with what is customary to your job targets to ensure that you are realistic in your job search.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p02">As with employer characteristics and compensation, itemize and prioritize what’s important to you. This way, you can look for jobs with these criteria, and you can assess job opportunities that come your way against the things that matter to you.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How to Make Trade-Offs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p01">Take all of these criteria, including industry, function, geography, employer characteristics, compensation, and lifestyle and environment, and create a master list of the things that matter to you. Rank that list, and note any criteria that you absolutely must have in a job. You should have some, but not many, must-have criteria. You want some must-have criteria because these will anchor your job search and keep you from chasing opportunities that will not make sense in the long run. At the same time, no job will meet all of your desired criteria, so you want to remain flexible and open to trading off some criteria for others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p02">One possible exercise to work through is to force rank your criteria. Make a master list of the criteria, including the preceding suggestions as well as any other criteria you wish to add. Eliminate from the list criteria you don’t care about—for example, “Sure, a bonus would be nice to have, but I would still take a job that doesn’t provide one.” For the remaining criteria, select your top half and then select the top half from there. Keep reducing until you get to the criteria you absolutely must have in your next job and can delete no further.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p03">A good example of using both external market criteria and internal personal criteria to make choices is Emily G., a recent undergraduate looking for her first full-time permanent position. She had interest in financial services and media, HR or office administration, and New York City. Her wish list still included a lot of job possibilities, and therefore the risk of a haphazard, diluted search. But Emily also highly prioritized a brand name company, which narrowed the field considerably. She also knew she did well in a more structured environment, so she looked for either established roles or at least a boss and colleagues with tendencies to coach and support. Otherwise, she was flexible, looking at new roles and old roles, staying open about all aspects of compensation, and otherwise not restricting herself except for brand name and structure.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch03_s03_s05_p04">Emily met her personal criteria because she knew to look for them. The job she accepted was not initially an obvious match because the company itself is very new, but it is a subsidiary of a brand name. The role also has the potential of being unstructured because of the start-up nature of the subsidiary, but Emily ensured she had supportive structures in place (an experienced boss with a supportive coaching style) before accepting. Similarly, you need to know your personal criteria, and find or negotiate your next job to meet them.</p>

                <li>Industry, function, and geography are not enough when selecting your next job.</li>
                <li>You also want to look at employer characteristics, compensation, and lifestyle and environment.</li>
                <li>Not all criteria will or should matter to you. You decide what matters and how much you prioritize the criteria or are willing to make trade-offs.</li>

                <li>Using the list of different personal criteria, what are your top three priorities? The force-ranking exercise will help if your top priorities aren’t immediately obvious.</li>
                <li>Do your current industry, function, and geography targets meet the personal criteria you prioritize? If you see that the work and life balance is your top criterion, but your industry of choice is known for a very difficult lifestyle, do you plan to change industries or at least add additional industries for consideration? What characteristics will you look for in specific organizations to make sure you meet your work and life balance preference?</li>
                <li>How will you reorient your search to more closely map industries and functions to your personal criteria? Remember the case study of Emily G., who was able to narrow down her target list to big companies in her target industry and function because she recognized that only these companies would have the possible support she prioritized.</li>
