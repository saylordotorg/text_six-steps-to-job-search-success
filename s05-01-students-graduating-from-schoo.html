        <h2 class="title editable block">Scenario 1: You Had a Summer Internship, and You Received a Full-Time Offer</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">If you had a summer internship and have received a full-time offer, you are in a great position. Hopefully, you enjoyed your summer internship and you will accept the offer you’ve received. If you will choose not to accept that offer, you’ll be in a great position to explore other options. But don’t waste time, as you’ll have a deadline to accept the first offer extended to you.</p>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p01">If you decide to accept your summer offer, your next steps will be to ensure that you complete all of your new hire paper work and that you have all the details necessary to begin working full time. In addition, you should continue to learn more about the company, the industry, the function, and the department in which you will work. Focus on increasing your network. Find other classmates at your school who might be involved in the same function and department as yours, and perhaps some who are joining the same industry. Join a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">LinkedIn</a><span class="glossdef">Social media site that is designed to share your professional information.</span></span> Group that focuses on your industry and your function and start a discussion. Conduct a Google Alert on your job, your industry, and your company so you are more knowledgeable about them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p02">Ask about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entry-level training</a><span class="glossdef">Represents the coursework given to new hires. Some larger firms have extensive entry-level training that can last for two months. Others have perhaps just one week, and others provide no upfront training and only on-the-job training.</span></span> if it is offered. If it is, perhaps you can prepare ahead of time for what you will be taught. Some companies not only administer entry-level training but also grade your performance and then share your grades with your manager. You will make the best impression possible if you are ranked at the very top of your class after training.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p03">If you choose not to accept this offer, quickly launch into a search for a full-time job. Your summer internship should have let you know exactly what you liked and did not like about the company you worked with. Use that information to move your job search forward and find the company and industry you are most interested in.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p04">It is rare that a student will decline an offer if they don’t have another, but that does happen.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Scenario 2: You Had a Summer Internship, and You Have Not Received a Full-Time Offer</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p01">You’ve strengthened your résumé with a solid internship, but unfortunately, that internship did not convert to a full-time job. This is not necessarily a reflection of your internship performance. Many companies can’t predict hiring needs so far in advance that they can offer a job to a student who isn’t graduating until months or even a year into the future. It’s not the end of the world; you can still achieve your goal of receiving a full-time offer.</p>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p01">The most important thing to know at this point is why you did not receive an offer. Ask for feedback, and ask that it be specific. Recruiters and hiring managers rarely give you interview feedback because our society is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">litigious</a><span class="glossdef">Prone to litigation. A society is litigious when its people are apt to sue quickly and often.</span></span>, but your past employer should give you very specific feedback. Perhaps you need to ramp up a particular skill. Perhaps you need to be more well read on a particular topic. Troubleshooting to address any feedback you receive will help in the long run.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p02">Check with your career services office. Ensure you know exactly which companies are coming on campus during the year. Research those companies and attend their marketing events. Talk to everyone you can about opportunities and be focused on exactly what you want to do.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p03">Conduct an off-campus job search. Conducting both an on-campus and off-campus job search ensures that you consider all of the companies in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">employable universe</a><span class="glossdef">A fun way of referring to every company who is hiring.</span></span>. Remember, of course, to focus sharply on your target.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p04">When you interview for a full-time position, the interviewer may ask about your prior summer and why you did not get an offer. While answering, always speak very positively about the experience and emphasize your contributions. Given that, you need to be honest about why you did not get an offer yet at the same time not harm your candidacy. Perhaps it was not the best fit because the company focuses on a market or product outside your areas of interest. For example, perhaps you were a research intern assigned to analyze the technology industry, but you now want to focus on health care. Perhaps your internship was in the right industry but you’d rather do something else within that interest. For example, you were a talent scout, and you now want to be more involved in the technology side of moviemaking. Think of something that enhances your candidacy with the organizations you are targeting now, especially if that something is not relevant to your summer employer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p05">If you get stuck on this issue, speak to career services or a professional career coach. This could be a tricky situation and you want to avoid losing an opportunity because you didn’t have a well-thought-out response.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p03">A liberal arts education offers much to employers, including communication, research, critical thinking skills, teamwork and leadership skills, flexibility, a global focus, and many, many other skills and strengths. All of these skills can be applied to industries such as advertising, education, health care, manufacturing, media and entertainment, even areas associated with the business majors (financial services, accounting, consulting, and so forth).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p04">If you’ve studied English, history, religion, philosophy, or psychology, you have honed your critical thinking skills (for example, comparative literature), you have been innovative in your learning (for example, art history, East meets West), and your writing skills are advanced because many of these courses require extensive research reports.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p05">If you’ve studied the arts, you could be innovative, have strong presentation skills, be flexible in your thinking, and have an eye for design and graphics.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Scenario 4: You Did Not Have a Summer Internship, and You Do Not Need a Full-Time Job</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p01">You might have many reasons for not having a summer internship and not needing a full-time job. Perhaps you are graduating college and you plan to go directly into graduate school. You may not need a full-time job; however, it would be worthwhile for an aspiring law student to have a summer internship in a law firm that specializes in an area of law you find especially interesting. Perhaps you want to know what it’s like to be a litigator, and eventually a judge, so working in the court system would be a tremendous learning opportunity for you, and a tremendous networking opportunity as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p02">No matter what your plans are after school, internships can always help expose you to different opportunities. You may be surprised to discover an interest you didn’t think you had. They are certainly invaluable tools for networking. At the very least, you can earn some money, which is always helpful!</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>When you are graduating, you likely will have four different scenarios: you received a full-time offer from your summer employer, you did not receive an offer, you didn’t have a summer internship, and lastly, you didn’t have a summer internship and you are not looking for a full-time offer. No matter which is your situation, you can take follow-up steps to strengthen your position.</li>
                <li>Business and technical majors may have a clearer idea of what career they want by virtue of having selected a major that translates into specific careers. Liberal arts majors may not have as clear an idea, but there are ways to leverage the strength of a liberal arts education.</li>

                <li>If you have a liberal arts education, pair up with another liberal arts major and brainstorm about what industries and jobs could use your strengths. Business majors should do the same.</li>
