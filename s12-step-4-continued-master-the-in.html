        <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
        <p class="simpara">You Can Become an Exceptional Interviewee</p>
        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_p01">You have now completed three full steps of your job search and half of the fourth step. You have accomplished four things:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_l01">
            <li>Identified your target</li>
            <li>Created a compelling marketing campaign</li>
            <li>Conducted in-depth research</li>
            <li>Networked</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_p02">The second half of step 4 focuses on the interview process. Networking and interviewing are paired for two reasons:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_l02">
            <li>A networking interaction is also a mini-interview that can easily turn into a legitimate interview; an interview is also a networking opportunity.</li>
            <li>The more effectively you network, the more effectively you will interview. Interviews lead to job offers and acceptances, so it’s vital that you network with people who have the influence to either arrange interviews or introduce you to people who can arrange interviews.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_p01">Each interaction with a company representative is a mini-interview. Future employers are constantly evaluating your behavior at every stage of the job search. For example, when they call you to discuss the potential of having a face-to-face interview, they note how you answer the phone and how you follow up. When you e-mail them information regarding your candidacy, they evaluate your writing ability and communication skills. While an interview is a formal meeting to evaluate your candidacy, the real interview begins much earlier.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_p02">An interview can be defined as a conversation between two or more people in which the interviewer asks questions to obtain information from the interviewee. A better definition might be an exchange of information between the interviewer and interviewee to assess if a match exists between a job’s requirements and a person’s skills and abilities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_p03">The second definition is much more proactive in the case of the interviewee. As an interviewee, you should not passively answer questions, but should employ strategies so you are presented in the best possible light. As an interviewee, you also are responsible for highlighting your strengths in the interview and giving answers that are detailed and results oriented. This chapter will give you such strategies.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_p04">Key strategies for a successful interview will be explored in depth in this chapter, but as an overview, you should have three goals:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_l01">
        <li>Know yourself.</li>
        <li>Know your résumé well enough to enthusiastically speak about every minute detail.</li>
        <li>Know the company, the position, and the industry for which you are interviewing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Know Yourself.</strong> Know your strengths well enough to match them to relevant job descriptions. If you have strong analytical skills, then analyst or accounting positions may be of interest. If you have strong client-service skills, perhaps a career in retail would be a great match. Knowing yourself allows you to target positions accurately, which then results in successful interviews and suitable positions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Know Your Résumé.</strong> You should be intimately aware of every detail on your résumé, including all past projects and the quantifiable results of those projects. If you are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stumped</a><span class="glossdef">Not knowing what to say when asked about a particular item or action.</span></span> on a question about your résumé, then it’s almost guaranteed that you will not get a second-round interview.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Know the Company, the Position, and the Industry.</strong> The third job search strategy focuses on research. You should know extensive amounts of information about the industry, the company, and the position before the interview and be knowledgeable enough to speak fluently about the company, its goals, and its ranking among its competition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s04_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Structure of a General Interview.</strong> An ordinary thirty-minute interview could have the following structure:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s04_l01">
        <li>Two to three minutes: greetings, small talk, interviewer sets the stage</li>
        <li>Twenty minutes: interviewer asks five to six questions</li>
        <li>Five minutes: interviewee has the opportunity to ask two to three questions</li>
        <li>Two to three minutes: discussion of next steps, closure of interview conversation</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s04_p02">Although the preceding structure is the most common, you shouldn’t expect this at all times. Interviews can veer from this typical structure for several reasons:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s04_l02">
        <li>The interviewer could try to throw you off your game and ask you only one question for the entire interview. That question could be “Tell me about yourself.” If that happens, you should be prepared to take control of the interview and run with it.</li>
        <li>The interviewer could think you are too well rehearsed, and ask <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hypothetical questions</a><span class="glossdef">Imaginary to a large degree. These are based on something that is completely uncertain.</span></span> that are difficult or impossible to practice before an interview.</li>
        <li>The interviewer could start by telling you to ask any questions you might have. In a typical interview, candidates ask questions at the end, but sometimes the interviewer has the candidate ask questions first. If that happens, you should have walked into the interview with five to seven well-researched questions about the company, the position, and perhaps the interviewer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Your Interview Strategy—Prepare and Practice.</strong> Multiple strategies will be reviewed to increase the chances of success during and after an interview, but the main strategy focuses on <em class="emphasis">preparation</em>. Prepare ahead of time and control what you can, so if something happens to throw you off your game, you will be much better prepared to deal with it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s05_p01">The more prepared you are, the better you will perform. It’s a universal truth that works for any skill or sport. If you play softball, you will be a better softball player if you practice as much as possible. It’s the same with interview skills: the more you practice, the better your skills will be. Many other strategies can help you prepare, including knowing the types of interviews, interviewers, the types of questions you will be asked, and the types of questions you can ask. Being prepared will strengthen your interview skills, which, in turn, will strengthen your chance of receiving a job offer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s06_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Interviewer.</strong> The interviewer has a very important job: they need to find the very best talent. Interviewers build their reputations on the quality of the individuals they hire. The stakes are high for you as well as the interviewer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s00_s06_p02">Preparation on your part is critical as well. You probably hope every interviewer you meet is skilled, but that may not always be the case. If your interviewer is not an expert in the interview process, you should be prepared to highlight your strengths no matter what questions are asked. Again, preparation is vitally important. This chapter will give you the best strategies to prepare for meeting any interviewer, regardless of their skill level.</p>

            <li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">Before you even walk into the interview room, you need to <strong class="emphasis bold">assess</strong> a few things:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Your strengths and weaknesses</li>

                <li>Your goals</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Know Your Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">It’s vital that you know your strengths and weaknesses because you should compare them to the job description. Is there a match between what they are looking for and your skills and abilities? If some of a job’s most important skills and abilities appear in your weakness column, there is no match. If your top three or four strengths appear in the job description, there is an obvious match.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Know Your Likes and Dislikes</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p01">A huge difference exists between spending your entire workday interacting with people versus sitting in front of a computer screen analyzing data all day. Creating a spreadsheet (or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dashboard</a><span class="glossdef">A concise, one-page document that includes several points of interest.</span></span>) that highlights sales figures and presenting that to your boss weekly is vastly different from standing in front of a group of twenty to thirty peers and managers and presenting that data.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p02">You must know your likes and dislikes because a workday can be long, and you should at least like most of what you will be doing. Some people are motivated by the amount of money they will make in a job, however, and if that works for them, it’s sufficient. It’s also important, however, to like the type of work you will be doing. It makes for a miserable day, week, month, and year if you do not.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p03">College internships are key because they expose you to work you might like, as well as work you definitely would not like. Having as many internships as possible is a goal every college student should have. It may be helpful to know that the vast majority of companies hire mostly juniors because they will graduate in one year and some companies would like to extend full-time offers to their summer class. But don’t let that dissuade you from seeking an internship if you are a freshman or sophomore. It may be more difficult to obtain an internship, but it’s definitely worth the effort if it gets you closer to what you do or do not want to do on a full-time basis.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Know Your Goals</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p01">While in college, it’s beneficial if your internships help you understand exactly what you want to do, and exactly what you need to do to get there. For example, if you are interested in marketing, you might have a sophomore internship at an advertising firm. You might end up doing mostly administrative work, but you get some exposure to the creative team. One of the team members allows you into a couple of meetings (with your manager’s permission), and you experience what their job is like. This is it for you! This is what you want to do.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p02">Your next logical step is to discuss with your manager if the next summer is a possibility, especially if you could work with the creative team. You hope your manager is so impressed with your work, your attention to detail, and your passion that you receive the open slot next summer in the creative department. If you aren’t guaranteed a job the following summer, make it your goal to target more advertising agencies and garner a job in a creative group. The more directed you are, the more likely it is you will get the job you want.</p>

        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02">

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p01">Preparation is key to succeeding in the interview process. The following steps will help you get a second round of interviews:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Research the industry, the company, the competitors, and the interviewer (if possible).</li>
                <li>Practice answering interview questions.</li>
                <li>Have a full dress rehearsal three days before the interview.</li>
                <li>Know where you are going in advance, and get there thirty to forty-five minutes early.</li>
                <li>Have a routine the day of the interview.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Know the Industry, the Company, the Competitors, and the Interviewer</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">Completing the research step ensures that you have fully researched the company, the industry, and the competition. Knowing how to interview well within the industry and company will help you get a second interview. You also might be able to research the interviewer using Google or <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com">http://www.linkedin.com</a>. Having relevant background information might give you helpful hints on how to position yourself.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s02_p01">The section of this chapter titled “Different Types of Questions” has a detailed list of the top questions asked during an interview and strategies to succeed with each question. Pay close attention to that section to help you prepare for an actual interview. For now, before you practice actual questions, you can do four things:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                    <li>Check with your career services department. Do they have an interview guide? Do they hold interview workshops? Will they conduct a mock interview with you? If so, take advantage of what is offered.</li>
                    <li>Google additional interview questions and look in the mirror as you practice answering these questions. Get an interview buddy to ask you these questions, as well as probing questions, to dig deeper into your answers.</li>
                    <li>Be confident when answering (even if you don’t feel confident), be positive, and don’t undersell yourself.</li>
                    <li>Focus on the results of each of your projects, tasks, and courses. A results-oriented candidate has a better chance getting the second interview and potentially the offer.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Have a Full Dress Rehearsal Three Days before the Interview</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s03_p01">Being prepared reduces stress and improves performance. Here is a checklist of things to do and consider before your interview day.</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_s02_s03_l01">
                    <li>Make sure your interview suit is clean and fits perfectly. You should feel very comfortable in the clothes you wear for an interview. This helps build your confidence.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to colors and style. If you are interviewing at a company where the dress is casual, it is still best to dress in a professional, conservative manner. Men and women should consider conservative suit colors such as navy, beige, and black. White or beige shirts give a very professional appearance. If you are not sure, it might help to shop at a professional clothing store.</li>
                    <li>Shine your shoes and be certain they are in excellent shape. Women should wear closed-toe shoes with moderate-height heels.</li>
                    <li>Take care in all aspects of your appearance, including your hair and nails.</li>
                    <li>Bring extra copies of your résumé.</li>
                    <li>Write down well-researched questions before the day of the interview.</li>
                    <li>Carry a professional-looking briefcase that has an inside portfolio containing paper and a pen.</li>
                    <li>Keep a small bottle of water in your briefcase in case your mouth gets dry.</li>
                    <li>Carry a cloth handkerchief in case your face perspires (for any reason). Some people sweat more than others and using a handkerchief is more professional (and sanitary) than using your hand. Avoid tissues because they can leave a residue that doesn’t make a very good impression. On a somewhat related note, if you happen to sneeze during an interview, sneeze into your sleeve versus into your hands. The interviewer will not want to shake your hand otherwise!</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Set two alarm clocks to make sure you wake up early enough to have plenty of time to get ready for the day.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s02_p01">Maintain good eye contact throughout the interview. It’s OK to look away occasionally, but, for the most part, eye contact should be steady. It shows confidence and inspires trust in all that you say.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s03">

                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s03_p01">When you are feeling stressed, a smile usually relaxes your face, which usually helps you to relax overall. An introductory or occasional smile shows that you are enjoying the conversation, and it adds to your confidence factor.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s04_p01">Practice your handshake. The Goldilocks approach is best: Don’t crush the interviewer’s hand, but don’t give a soft, floppy handshake, either. Your handshake should be firm and businesslike. If you get nervous to the point of having a sweaty palm, wipe it against your pants leg or skirt just before you shake your interviewer’s hand.</p>

It’s fine to cross your legs if you feel more comfortable doing so, but avoid looking too relaxed. You should be poised and fully focused on the interviewer, ensuring that you answer all questions to the best of your ability.</p>

        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s06">

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s06_p01">If you’ve met others in the company, mention that up front. It’s a great way to open an interview because you establish that you’ve already met others at the company, and the interviewer also can contact them for feedback.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07">

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p01">The more focused you are during an interview, the more successful you will be. Focus on the question asked and answer it directly. If you think you’ve gone off course for any reason, it’s OK to ask the interviewer if you are on the right track. Your answer should have a beginning, a middle, and an end that includes a real, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tangible</a><span class="glossdef">Something real and measurable.</span></span>, and preferably positive result. Here is an example of a question asked and an effective answer:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: Jenna, what was your biggest contribution to the company you interned with last summer?</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_bl02">
                <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p03"><em class="emphasis">Answer</em>: Throughout the summer, we had approximately five to six team meetings where the entire staff of ten engineers and their direct reports were present to discuss the major goal of the summer: the construction of a new courthouse.</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p04">I was tasked with drafting the agenda of these meetings and the agenda notes, which verified all that was discussed and agreed upon. The agendas directed complex meetings, and the agenda notes served as key documents that verified and clarified what was discussed and agreed upon during the meetings.</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p05">My first draft of the first agenda was much too broad, but with feedback from my manager, I ensured it included all the details necessary to hold a productive and effective meeting and created the structure for the agenda notes document. The agenda notes were typically three to five pages long, and by the second meeting, I was drafting the agenda and publishing the notes without any revisions from my manager.</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p06">I received exceptional feedback from several department heads because, in many instances, the notes saved countless hours of work. For example, during the third meeting, we reversed course on a previously agreed-upon strategy for the front columns of the courthouse. One of the key assistant engineers was not at the meeting, and when her peer brought her up to speed, he forgot to mention that the columns were changed from the Roman style columns to the Grecian columns, which needed a more intricate support system from the roof to the courthouse steps. Luckily, she read my agenda notes, which highlighted any course changes in red, and saved about two weeks’ worth of work, which was easily several thousand dollars. It also kept everyone on track regarding the completion date, which is June 2014.</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_s07_p07">To improve this process overall, I loaded the agenda and the notes into the department’s central files so instead of relying upon hard copies or e-mailed copies, everyone had one place to go for this important document that kept everyone on track. They are still using the improvements I implemented, so I’m very proud of that.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p01">E-mail, versus a handwritten note, is preferred for many reasons:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>Your note will be immediately received by the interviewer. It’s common courtesy to thank people for their time right away, and manners count quite a bit during the job search.</li>
                <li>Your ability to write a concise business note is demonstrated.</li>
                <li>Your quick communication keeps you at the top of the interviewer’s mind.</li>
                <li>Your e-mailed thank-you note can be shared easily and often by everyone who interviewed you. This positive momentum keeps you in a positive light with all parties.</li>
                <li>Your e-mail is an opportunity to quickly confirm that you have the critical skills necessary to do a fantastic job. In the e-mail, you can reiterate the skills you have or mention something specific that was discussed in the interview, thus making an even stronger case for why you’d be a great hire.</li>
                <li>Your e-mail can include an attached article about the company or about an interest you share with the interviewer.</li>
                <li>Your e-mailed thank-you note is more likely to receive a response from the interviewer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_s01_p02">Some individuals believe a handwritten note distinguishes you from others; while that may be true, you never know if it arrived. You could send an e-mail and a handwritten note to cover all the bases, but don’t use the exact wording for both notes. Using a high-quality, professional notepaper or stationery is recommended.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>If you forget to turn your cell phone off and it rings, apologize and quickly turn off the phone. Don’t look at the number of the person calling you.</li>
            <li>If you are late, call in advance to notify the interviewer and ask if the interview can proceed. Apologize when the interview takes place.</li>
            <li>If you have a wardrobe malfunction—a popped button, a run in your stockings, or you spilled coffee on your clothing—a little humor might help.</li>
            <li>If you went on a tangent and did not answer the question directly, check to make sure you are on track or ask that the question be repeated.</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s01_s04_l02">
                <li>Assess your strengths and weaknesses, your likes and dislikes, and your goals before you begin the interview process.</li>
                <li>Knowing what to do before, during, and after an interview is critical to your overall success.</li>
                <li>Having a routine that you follow during the days before and the day of the interview will lower stress and increase your chances to succeed.</li>
                <li>The more prepared you are for an interview, the more likely you are to succeed. Control what you can through preparation and practice and when the unexpected happens, you will be in a better position to manage it.</li>
                <li>If things go wrong during an interview, you can take specific steps to regain your composure.</li>
                <li>Sending a thank-you note is a perfect way to thank the interviewer for their time and keep the lines of communication open. Identify something in the interview that you want to highlight in your note, yet keep it short and concise.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Behavioral Interview</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p01">The vast majority of interview candidates will participate in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">behavioral interview</a><span class="glossdef">The most popular form of interviewing, as it is based on specific past performances versus hypothetical situations. Behavioral questions follow the premise that past behavior is a clear indicator of future behavior.</span></span>. Behavioral questions focus on past performances versus hypothetical situations, following the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">premise</a><span class="glossdef">A logical conclusion.</span></span> that past behavior is a clear indicator of future behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p02">Later in this chapter, a comprehensive list is presented of the most-asked behavioral questions, along with strategies to answer them. Just about any other question asked is a derivative of these questions, so carefully review that section and practice your answers. Questions will relate to aspects of your past work and educational experiences. Here are four typical behavioral interview questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>What was the toughest project you ever completed? Tell me about it.</li>
            <li>Who was the most difficult customer you ever helped? Tell me about that situation.</li>
            <li>What was your most challenging class? Tell me why it was challenging.</li>
            <li>Were you ever a member of a team? What was your role, what was the goal of the team project, and did it go smoothly or was there an issue? What was the end result of the project?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p03">The following strategies will help you answer behavioral questions successfully:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_l02">
            <li>Never mention anything negative about your past managers, past professors, or past clients. Even if a particular individual was difficult, speak instead about the challenge and the subsequent approval you received when you succeeding in satisfying that person.</li>
            <li>Focus on presenting an image of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enthusiastic</a><span class="glossdef">Your excitement or interest in a topic.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">optimistic</a><span class="glossdef">You see the positive possibilities in a situation, a person, or an outcome.</span></span> problem solver. Interviewers aren’t interested in someone who was downtrodden or didn’t get along with the team in general.</li>
            <li>Answer questions directly, and include a beginning, a middle, and an end in your answer.</li>
            <li>Quantify your answers whenever possible. For example, if you worked in your school’s library and you are asked about this work, include the number of books you managed per day, whether it was ten, one hundred, or one thousand. It’s fine to estimate.</li>
            <li>Ensure your answer is tied to the bottom line. Using the library example once more, your answer could include that using the electronic checkout system decreased lost books by 75 percent.</li>
            <li>Focus on the question asked to help you avoid going off on tangents.</li>
            <li>Ask the interviewer to repeat the question if you think you have gone off on a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tangent</a><span class="glossdef">That you are digressing, or getting further away from the question.</span></span> or if you didn’t quite understand the question.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Case Interviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Case interviews</a><span class="glossdef">Case interviews are used to understand a candidate’s ability to problem solve and develop a strategy to solve a difficult situation.</span></span> are predominately used in management consulting, though they are sometimes used in a variety of fields, including financial services, healthcare, consumer products, and education. A case interview is a hypothetical business problem, or <em class="emphasis">case</em>, that the interviewee is expected to solve during the interview. The case tests a variety of the interviewee’s skills and expertise, including analysis, logic, structuring of a problem, math, accounting or economics knowledge, specific industry knowledge, communication, creativity, and ability to deliver under pressure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02">Case interviews might include short questions to estimate the size of a market:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>How many teenage Americans bought hiking boots last year?</li>
            <li>How many Christmas trees are sold in December in California?</li>
            <li>How many disposable cameras are purchased in London on a single day?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p03">The interviewer does not expect you to know the specific answer, but that you estimate a final answer based on different facts (e.g., the population of the United States). The interviewer wants you to break down this broad request into smaller steps that can be calculated to see how you structure a problem. The interviewer is also testing your basic math skills and ability to work under pressure. The following information applies to the question on hiking boots:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>The population of the United States is about 300 million people.</li>
            <li>It is less obvious how many of those are teenagers, so you have to estimate. If life expectancy is approximately eighty years and equal numbers in each decade (ages zero to ten, eleven to twenty, and so forth) are estimated, then there are eight buckets of ages, including a teenage bucket, so the number of people in the teenage years represents 12 to 15 percent of the total population.</li>
            <li>Fifteen percent of 300 million is 45 million, but not every teenager wears hiking boots and not every teenager buys boots every year.</li>
            <li>If you estimate that 25 percent of teenagers wear hiking boots, then teenagers who purchase hiking books number about eleven million.</li>
            <li>If you estimate that a typical hiker buys a new pair every other year, then about five and a half million teenagers buy hiking boots each year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p04">Remember that the interviewer does not expect a specific answer, but rather wants to see the process you follow to estimate the answer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p05">Case interviews might also be as long as thirty to forty-five minutes of broad strategy or operations questions about a detailed problem. You may be asked how to manage a hypothetical teaching situation. You may be given a hospital scenario and asked how to streamline processes. You may be given data about the company or industry involved in the question presented. You may be asked to review charts, accounting statements, or other background material, such as in the following question: The CEO of a leading national toy company is considering acquiring a popular neighborhood toy shop in Austin, Texas. How would you advise the CEO whether or not to purchase the shop?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p06">You might then be given more information about the national toy company, or you might be expected to ask for what you need. The questions you ask are part of what the interviewer is testing because your questions reveal the types of data you think are important to assess to make the purchase decision. You are trying to assess if the neighborhood shop fits into the national company’s strategy, and, if so, whether the cost of buying and integrating the neighborhood shop will be offset by potential future revenues.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p07">Many large consulting firms, such as McKinsey and Bain, put sample cases and solutions on their websites. Books also offer sample cases and solutions. Many schools offer case-preparation workshops via either career services or extracurricular consulting clubs. Case interviews are very different from general job interviews but are rarely used except for management consulting jobs. Therefore, don’t spend any time preparing for case interviews unless you want a management consulting job. If you do want a job in management consulting, case interview practice is absolutely necessary. You will not get hired by a consulting firm without successfully completing several case interviews.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p08">If you are interviewing outside the consulting industry, meet with a friend who is in your chosen profession. Ask them to tell you about when they were interviewed, and ask them to interview you. This can be a tremendous learning experience and can prepare you for success, so your time will be well spent in arranging a mock interview ahead of time.</p>

                <li>Knowing the different types of interviews is important to succeeding at each.</li>
                <li>A behavioral interview is the most expected interview form for the vast majority of positions. Behavioral interviews rely on past performance as an indication of future performance.</li>
                <li>Case interviews are most widely used for consulting positions. The goal of a case interview is to test your logic and ability to problem solve quickly and effectively.</li>
                <li>Informational interviews, reviewed in <a class="xref" href="ceniza_1.0-ch06#ceniza_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Step 3: Conduct In-Depth Research"</a>, the section titled Informational Interviews, are a useful way to learn about an industry and a specific job through someone who has built their career in that area. You ask most of the questions, so you must prepare well in advance to get the most amount of information possible and impress the person with whom you are meeting.</li>
                <li>Some interviewers may merge aspects of behavioral and case interviewing into one interview session. Knowing how to succeed at each type of interview is a wise strategy.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p01">One of four methods might be used to interview you:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Live interviews (one-on-one and a panel type)</li>

            <li>Video or Skype interviews</li>

        </ol>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Live (One-on-One and a Panel Type)</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">Live, or face-to-face, interviews, are the most common interview interaction. An increasing trend of recruiters is to pair up with another colleague and have two or more interviewers per interview candidate. Many candidates will end up interviewing before a panel of interviewers, so be prepared for that to happen as well.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p02">You will need to employ all of the strategies outlined earlier in this chapter, in the section titled “Different Types of Interviews.” In addition, here are some specific strategies to employ when you are interviewing with one or more interviewers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p03">When you are interviewing with only one person, the focus is clear—it’s on one person. Ensure your nonverbal and verbal communication is focused, positive, and results oriented. The more you practice, troubleshoot, and improve, the more you will succeed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p04">If you are interviewing with two or more interviewers at the same time, focus and practice are just as important, but you can employ a few additional strategies:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Focus on the person asking the question to ensure you fully understand the question. When you answer, however, look at all interviewers in the room (even if they are not speaking). Use the lighthouse approach, and just as a lighthouse’s light scans from side to side, do the same with your eye contact and connect with everyone in the room.</li>
                <li>Practice and helpful critiques for improvement cannot be emphasized enough. Conduct as many <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mock interviews</a><span class="glossdef">A practice interview. Practice interviews are not conducted by your desired employer, but by a person knowledgeable and familiar with the interview process.</span></span> as possible because your skills will improve with each attempt. Practice also will help you strengthen your performance significantly, thus helping you succeed in either gaining a second-round interview or getting an offer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Phone (One-on-One and a Panel Type)</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p01">Phone interviews are just as important, if not more so, than face-to-face interviews. In down economies, more companies choose to conduct interviews via the phone versus face-to-face to save time, money (if they have to pay your expense to come to their office), and effort. So preparation and practice are key to succeeding on the phone.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p02">Prepare for a phone interview (similar to a regular interview) by taking seven important steps:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Research the industry, the company, the competitors, and the interviewer (if possible).</li>
                <li>Match your strengths to the job description.</li>
                <li>Practice interview questions, focusing on the results of your projects and tasks.</li>
                <li>Ask a friend to interview you over the phone so you are used to the medium.</li>
                <li>Be proactive about discussing your strengths and have concrete examples of how you have used them.</li>
                <li>Prepare questions for the interviewer.</li>
                <li>Ask what the next steps will be.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p03">Phone interviews have several advantages:</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="para">You can treat the interview like an open-book test and have several items at hand to help you:</p>

                        <li>A copy of your résumé</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p05">Phone interviews have some disadvantages:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_l05">
                <li>You lose your ability to make a first great impression visually.</li>
                <li>You lose the ability to impress with body language such as eye contact, a good handshake, and so forth.</li>
                <li>You cannot read the interviewer’s body language.</li>
                <li>You might become confused if more than one person is asking questions, especially if a speakerphone is used.</li>
                <li>You might be left in the awkward position of not knowing what to do next if the recruiter doesn’t value phone interviews as much as face-to-face interviews. They might reschedule or not call when they said they would.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p06">Strategies for a successful phone interview include the following:</p>

                        <li>Ask someone to walk your dog for the hour you are on the phone, or put it in a fenced backyard. If you have a cat with a loud meow, put it in another room where it cannot be heard.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p01">When you are at a more senior level, interviews might take place with someone in a different city, state, or even overseas. In such a case, a videoconference or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Skype</a><span class="glossdef">A software application that allows users to make voice calls over the Internet.

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p02">Strategies to succeed during a videoconference interview include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>When answering questions, look into the camera instead of looking at the person on the screen. If you look at the camera, your eyes will meet the eyes of the person on the other end of the computer, making for a better connection. If you look at the person on the computer monitor when answering the question, you will appear to be looking down. It’s tempting to look at the person’s face versus the camera because you want to read their impression, but try to avoid this.</li>
                <li>Practice this technique by speaking to a friend via Skype. It’s the exact same medium as a teleconferenced interview, and will give you the much-needed practice.</li>
                <li>Posture is very important, as it is with all interviews, but especially in a videoconference because the interviewer will see you from the shoulders up.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Taped Interviews</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s04_p01">Taped interviews are so rarely used that you probably will not encounter them. They are primarily used to hire a large number of people for the same exact position, for example, sales positions. If a company has a goal to hire one hundred or five hundred salespeople, a taped interview saves them time in reviewing candidate answers, since all the questions might be the same. Taped interviews are also helpful when hiring salespeople in different parts of the country because taped interviews save the enormous expense of flying interviewers from city to city to find the best possible candidates.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s04_p02">Companies that use taped interviews may direct you to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">satellite office</a><span class="glossdef">Regional offices that are not the headquarters of a company.</span></span> where the taping takes place. You would be seated opposite a computer or computer kiosk, and you would be given an overview of the process. Taped interviews could involve timed responses, so the pressure could be high. Remember these types of interviews are rare, but it is good to know they exist and how they are formatted.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s04_p03">Strategies to succeed in taped interviews include the following:</p>

                <li>Practice taping yourself before a taped interview using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Flip Video</a><span class="glossdef">A product that easily allows you to take a video yourself or others.

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p01">If your interview takes place on campus, you will probably receive instructions from your career services office regarding the date and time of the interview. Check with the office to ensure you know how you will be notified. Most career services offices have a general check-in area, a waiting area, and very small interview rooms. It’s best to practice in these rooms ahead of time, so you know exactly what to expect. Some rooms are literally five feet by five feet.</p>

        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s02">

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p01">If your interview takes place off campus, the company with which you are interviewing will send instructions regarding where to report and when. Ensure you know exactly how to get there, and arrive early if at all possible because you probably will need to go through security. Bring the interview schedule with you; it should include the name(s) of the individuals with whom you will interview and their contact information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p02">If you need to travel via train or plane to an interview, dress professionally on the way there.

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s03_p01">Most often, candidates will be interviewed in the interviewer’s office, but there are times when you will be interviewed in a conference room. Some conference rooms are glass-enclosed areas, and it can be distracting to interview as individuals look in and walk by. Regardless of the setting, maintain your focus on the questions asked and the interview at hand.</p>

        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">During a Meal</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s04_p01">Mealtime interviews can be tricky situations because food and drink are involved. Strike a healthy balance of not being ravenous but not leaving your plate untouched either. Focus your full attention on the conversation and interview at hand. It is wise to stay away from messy marinara sauces and long strings of pasta because they can easily stain your clothing. Forgo alcohol at all costs and certainly if you are not of legal age to consume alcohol. If you are not comfortable with dining etiquette, familiarize yourself with it to increase your comfort level. Know which fork is correct to use for salad versus dinner. Research this so you are prepared in advance. Interviews that take place during a meal can heighten nerves and cause you to spill a glass of water, which doesn’t bode well for your confidence level. Practice can only help, so try to attend a dining etiquette class or study proper techniques to ensure a good impression.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s04_p02">No matter what the venue, dress well and take extra copies of your résumé, a portfolio with paper and a pen that works, a list of questions you will ask, and perhaps a bottle of water just in case you need it.</p>

                    <li>Knowing the different types of interviews is important to succeeding at each. Knowing the pros and cons to live and phone interviews can ensure you get a second interview or perhaps the job offer.</li>
                    <li>Having a one-on-one interview is very different from having to interview before a panel of people. Researching the individuals who will interview you can decrease your stress and help you perform optimally.</li>
                    <li>Some interviewers may merge aspects of behavioral and case interviewing into one interview session. Knowing how to succeed at each is a wise strategy.</li>

    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Open-Ended Questions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p01">Open-ended questions don’t have specific answers. They include questions like the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Tell me about yourself. Walk me through your career. Why did you make the choices you made?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p02">Such questions present an opportunity to tell your story in an engaging, articulate, and compelling way. Explain why you selected the school(s) you selected, your major and your minor, and your GPA (if it’s above 3.3). Describe the jobs you’ve had and how you got them. Did you apply directly or did you get them through networking? What were your most significant accomplishments at each job? Highlight significant accomplishments that may or may not be explicit in your résumé. Often, a theme will emerge, but if that isn’t the case, talk about your decisions in a positive light.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_l02">
            <li>With which skills and functions are you most comfortable? If I were to assign you a project based on your expertise, what would I give you?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p03">If you enjoy working with clients, talk about your specific achievements and how you helped your clients. Have you served them well enough for them to be repeat customers? Have they referred other clients to you? If you are very strong analytically, give an example of the most analytical project on which you’ve worked and the project’s outcome.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_l03">
            <li>What are your weakest skills, and how are you addressing them? What areas would your supervisors say you need to develop?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p04">Everyone has strengths and everyone has weaknesses. You should do a substantive assessment of your weaknesses prior to an interview. A weakness should never be a critical component of the job for which you are applying. If there is a trick to answering this question effectively, it’s to highlight what you are doing to strengthen each weakness. For example, if public speaking is something you consider a weakness, you can say that to improve this, you raise your hand as much as possible in class, and you volunteer to present whenever possible. The more prepared you are with the content of your presentation, the better you perform.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_l04">
            <li>What do you do for fun? What do you do in your free time? What do you like to read?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p05">These questions present an opportunity to enthusiastically and specifically discuss what you enjoy doing in your spare time. If you enjoy tennis, talk about how long you have been playing and your favorite player. If you enjoy reading, mention the last great book you read.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Specific Questions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p01">Specific questions have concrete answers and might include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Tell me about this [the interviewer can point to anything on your résumé, whether it be a project, an employer, a class, a skill, or a hobby].</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">You must be able to quickly and completely discuss any topic from your résumé and its relevance to your professional career. You should be able to recount every detail about each project, and enthusiastically relay those details to your interviewer. If you are not enthusiastic about your work, they will not be either. Also highlight the result of your work or any project about which they want to know more.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_l02">
            <li>Tell me about your favorite project, your most significant project, or a project that demonstrates your leadership, project management, analytical, research, or communications skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">When answering this question, remember who sponsored the project, the project’s objective and deliverable, steps you took to complete the project, and the results of your efforts. Note your role as well as the roles of other team members. Be specific and quantify the results.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_l03">
            <li>Tell me about a project where something went wrong or tell me about a difficult client.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">Everyone has worked on projects where something went wrong. If we procrastinated, we learned to become more disciplined in our approach to projects. If someone didn’t do their part of the project, which then caused us to do extra work, we learned to communicate more clearly and check the project’s progress on a regular basis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p05">We also have worked with difficult clients. The trick is to not say anything negative about a client. If a client was demanding, remember that all clients have a right to make demands. We need to raise our game to ensure they are pleased with the service and our level of professionalism. Never make negative comments about a client, a boss, a peer, or a company. Doing so sends an immediate red flag to the interviewer, so avoid such negativity at all costs. Position everything in a positive light, which can only help your candidacy.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_l04">
            <li>What do you think about current events or significant events in the employer’s industry?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p06">Interviewers want to know that you are knowledgeable about current events, especially those pertaining to their industry. The very best candidates are well versed in the current news, so be prepared to discuss one or two items. It’s important that you cite the source of the news and what you learned from it. If you did subsequent research about the topic, discuss that as well. It’s an opportunity to highlight your research and your passion for this industry.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Motivation Questions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p01">Interviewers often want to know about a candidate’s motivation by asking the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>With which firms are you interviewing? What positions are you seeking? How will you choose?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p02">The most savvy interviewers know that the best candidates interview with multiple companies. Many candidates are comfortable discussing specific companies with which they are interviewing, and, from a recruiting perspective, it’s fine to mention the company names. If you would rather not discuss this, mention that you are currently interviewing with other companies, but this company is your number one choice and highlight why you want to work there. They should get the hint that you don’t want to mention specific companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p03">No matter what company is interviewing you, ensure that you know why you want to work for that particular company. Know their strong points and know their competitors. Know clearly why you want to work for them versus their competitors.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_l02">
            <li>What do you hope to accomplish in your career? Where do you see yourself in one, five, or more years?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p04">Your research will help you answer this question. If you’ve conducted some informational interviews, you will have a clear idea of what a career can look like in one, five, and ten years. It is also important to network with peers who have interned at the companies in which you are interested because they can share specific information with you. For example, consulting, investment banking, and brand management have well-defined career paths. Advertising has a defined career path, but it may not be as defined as other businesses and industries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p05">Additional sources of information on this topic can be gathered on various job-seeker sites such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.vault.com">http://www.vault.com</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wetfeet.com">http://www.wetfeet.com</a>. Career services can be a huge resource, as can alumni who are in the industries in which you are most interested.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_l03">
            <li>What questions do you have for the interviewer?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p06">This can be a make-or-break question because some interviews consist of just this one question. Every interview candidate should enter an interview with five to seven questions written down in advance. These questions should come directly from your research.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_l04">
            <li>Why do you want this position? Why do you want to work with this company?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p07">Answers to these questions will come from your research. Have a specific reason you want to work at the company doing the exact job for which you are interviewing. Is the brand name very strong, giving you an opportunity to work with the best? Is the brand name not yet a household name, giving you an opportunity to make it so?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p08">It’s also important to know what skills you will gain in this specific position and which will enable you to be successful. Will the position strengthen your analytical skills? Will it enable you to become a subject-matter expert? Be specific in your answer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Unconventional Questions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_p01">Some interviewers may think you are too rehearsed and may want to inject a bit of stress; perhaps they want to shake you up a bit by asking what may seem to be crazy or certainly bizarre interview questions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? Why?</li>
            <li>If you were a car, what color would you be? Why?</li>
            <li>If you were an item in the supermarket, what item would you be? Why?</li>
            <li>If you were an animal, what kind of animal would you be? Why?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_p02">Note that these questions are rare and you probably will not be asked them, but since preparation is key, it’s worth examining why they are asked. These types of questions are asked to get a true glimpse into your personality. The “If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?” question could be answered the following way:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_l02">
            <li>If you were a corporate research analyst who relied purely on your research to describe a stock, and that research would be shared with hundreds of portfolio managers, you might say you were a redwood tree. A redwood is one of the strongest trees on the planet and has roots that grow hundreds of feet into the ground. Not even the strongest of winds can cause the redwood to sway.</li>
            <li>If you were applying to be a technology customer service representative who troubleshoots during their entire day, you may say that you were a palm tree. A palm tree bends and yields to gentle breezes and hurricanes alike, but it survives almost anything that comes its way and stands tall and straight the minute the wind stops.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="informalfigure large medium-height block">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_p03">The two types of trees have very different characteristics, yet they both survive and thrive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_p04">Unconventional questions have no correct answer, but when asked them, four strategies can help you succeed:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_l03">
            <li>Practice answering a few of these types of questions. If you need a few minutes to consider your answer during an interview, it’s fine to ask for a bit of time.</li>
            <li>Answer by showing something positive or beneficial about you and your personality.</li>
            <li>Avoid humor and answer the question seriously and sincerely.</li>
            <li>Work backward to the answer. Think about a characteristic that is important to the job, and then match it to a tree, a fruit, or an item in a supermarket.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Illegal Questions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s05_p01">Illegal or discriminatory questions include references to the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s05_l01">
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Birthplace</li>
            <li>Childcare arrangements</li>
            <li>Ethnicity and race</li>
            <li>Disability</li>
            <li>Marital and family status</li>
            <li>National origin</li>
            <li>Religion</li>
            <li>Sexual orientation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s05_p02">If you are asked any question relating to the preceding topics, it could be for one of two reasons. Either the interviewer is asking an illegal question or the interviewer might not be well versed in interview techniques. Many hiring managers have not been formally trained in interview techniques, and that lack of training can result in asking an illegal question.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s05_p03">It is hoped that the question would be harmless enough so that you can answer it without feeling uncomfortable. If you feel uncomfortable answering something, tactfully say that the question doesn’t relate to the job. Try to move onto another question or ask a question pertaining to the job to get the interview back on track.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s04_s05_p04">If you feel that you were subjected to discrimination, speak to someone at your career services office. They could provide the guidance necessary at this stage of your job search. If that is not possible, consult a friend or professor and ask for guidance in your next steps. This is not a matter to be taken lightly, so it’s important to get help from someone who is familiar with these issues.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_l01">
            <li>Understand why recruiters might be annoyed at certain interview behavior and learn how to avoid unpleasant interactions of any kind.</li>
            <li>Learn about the importance of body language and practice until your body language is positive and impressive.</li>
            <li>Learn strategies to keep your energy positive and strong throughout the interview day.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_p01">A number of things can annoy an interviewer and must be avoided at all costs. The following includes a list of things you should not do. Mock interviews are especially helpful at this stage because sometimes candidates are not aware they are doing things that are clear turnoffs to interviewers, so proceed with caution.</p>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Not Being Prepared</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_p01">Being unprepared is an insult to the interviewer who is investing their time and energy into meeting with you. You should be there on time, have several copies of your résumé in your portfolio, focus on answering any question asked, and have a list of questions to ask at the end of the interview.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Negative Body Language</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_p01">Positive body language such as looking the interviewer in the eye and shaking their hand firmly when saying hello inspires trust. Poor body language can eliminate you as a potential candidate. Practice answering questions with a friend and look them straight into the eye. Smile when you talk about big goals that you have achieved. You may look away now and then, but for the most part hold their gaze throughout the interview. Sit up straight in an attentive position to help ensure you make a good impression.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Appearing Tense</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p01">Stress is a vital component of an interview because you want the job and you need to impress. Using that stress to perform better is key, and, with practice, you can appear more relaxed than you actually are. For example, if your palm sweats a bit, discreetly wipe your hand on your pants leg or skirt before you shake the interviewer’s hand. Preparing in advance usually lowers stress, but if you still need additional methods to calm yourself before an interview, try listening to soothing music before entering the building or read something inspirational before the interview. Taking deep breaths before you enter the building can lower stress a great deal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Not Focusing on the Question and Not Answering It Directly</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s04_p01">If your interviewer asks for a one- to two-minute overview, don’t spend six to eight minutes regurgitating your résumé. Focus and listen carefully to everything the interviewer asks you. If they ask for a one- to two-minute overview, make sure you give them one to two minutes. If you feel you might be going on a tangent and not answering the question, it’s fine to ask if you are going in the right direction, or you can ask the recruiter to repeat the question and start over. Practice is important, even when you practice going off the topic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Waning Energy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s05_p01">The interview process is strenuous. If you interview with one person, it’s easy to keep your energy up. However, some interviews might be set up where you will interview with multiple people or several individual people throughout the day, and, in some cases, on different floors and in different buildings. Your energy level must be as strong and consistent with your seventh interview as it was with your first. To avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">waning energy</a><span class="glossdef">You start off at a high level of energy and your energy then trails off and lowers noticeably.</span></span>, bring a small bottle of water with you to help you feel refreshed. If your interview day will be several hours long, bring a small snack bar to help you stay alert.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Blaming Others for Your Poor Performance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s06_p01">Putting anyone or anything in a negative light is not a good strategy for an interview. Criticizing your past peers, boss, or company puts you in a negative light. Interviewers red flag any type of negative comment and might probe for more negative energy lurking in other interview responses.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Not Treating Everyone with Respect</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s05_s07_p01">Treat everyone you meet during the day with the utmost respect, whether it is the security guard, the administrative assistant, or the actual interviewer. Be respectful if you are trying to rush through security or if you are holding an elevator for someone. All of these individuals communicate with each other, and if you leave a bad impression with any of them, it could end your candidacy. Be courteous and kind to everyone you meet. Manners do count.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">8.6</span> Chapter Review and Exercises</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p01">Control what you can control, and your interview will be more successful. This includes doing the following, but this list is far from exhaustive:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_l01">
        <li>Assess your strengths and weaknesses before the interview.</li>
        <li>Research the company and its competitors in advance of your meeting.</li>
        <li>Prepare and practice interview questions.</li>
        <li>Create a routine for the day of the interview to ensure you don’t rush or skip important steps.</li>
        <li>Write down five to seven questions to ask at the end of your interview to prove you are motivated to get this job offer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p02">Remember that interviews are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subjective</a><span class="glossdef">An interviewer can make up their mind based on nonscientific data. They can have a preconceived notion of you as a candidate that has nothing to do with your strengths.</span></span> and that a second interview is never a guarantee. Budgets can shift and your targeted company may have to pull an open requisition. Perhaps the company wants to promote from within and they may hire an internal candidate. Many interviewers hire in their own image, regardless of any interviewer training course they may attend. No matter what happens at the end of your interview, it’s important to stay positive and it’s equally important to not take it personally.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p03">Regardless of the interview’s outcome, and especially if you don’t get the job, thank the interviewer for the interaction. Continue to keep in touch because that person can become an important part of your network. Leaving a positive impression can only help your future prospects because jobs for which you would be a perfect fit might open in the near term. Remember also that recruiters and hiring managers tend to move from company to company, and there is a strong likelihood that your paths may cross again. Maintaining positive relationships can only help your career.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p04">Lastly, if you interview for a position and you don’t get it, at least appreciate the value and practice of your experience. Troubleshoot what could have gone better and improve on that one thing. If you are proactive enough at strengthening your interview ability and ensuring you have enough interviews lined up, you increase your chances of getting a job offer. Once that happens, you will probably be in the interviewer’s seat before long.</p>
