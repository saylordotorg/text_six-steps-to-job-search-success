        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_p01">At this point in your search, you have completed step 1 with a specific industry, function, and geography in mind.</p>
        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_p02">Step 2 (creating a compelling marketing campaign) consists of four distinct tools that can help construct a strong, effective, and successful job search:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_l01">
            <li>Your résumé</li>
            <li>Your cover letter</li>
            <li>Your online profile</li>
            <li>Your pitch</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_p03">This chapter will focus only on your résumé. <a class="xref" href="ceniza_1.0-ch05#ceniza_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Step 2 (Continued): Create a Compelling Marketing Campaign, Part II: Cover Letter, Pitch, and Online Profile"</a> will complete this step, and we will then focus on the remainder of your marketing campaign: your cover letter, your pitch, and your online profile.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Marketing Focus.</strong> Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">résumé</a><span class="glossdef">A brief written account of personal, educational, and professional qualifications and experience, usually prepared by an applicant for a job.</span></span> is a marketing document that sells your candidacy. It provides an outline of your educational background, your work experience, and the key skills you have acquired. Your résumé should be marketed in a format that is pleasing to read, efficient in its use of the English language, and so concise that it fits on one page. Once you have approximately ten years of experience, it is more acceptable to have a two-page résumé, but until then, you should adhere to a one-page document. Recruiters can frown on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audacity</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to a bold move or presumption.</span></span> of a college student with a two-page résumé. Whether you are not sure you can fill a one-page résumé, or whether you think it’s not possible to fit your information to only one page, this chapter will help you get to your goal: an exceptional, one-page résumé.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Quality, Clarity, and Accuracy.</strong> Your résumé is the most critical component, or cornerstone, of your marketing campaign and it must meet two important criteria:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s02_l01">
        <li>
            <p class="para">Your résumé must be written in a clear and concise manner so the reader can quickly grasp what you offer as a candidate. Most seasoned recruiters scan a résumé in about seven to ten seconds, but do not let that short review time throw you. Recruiters have an eye for the key things to look for in a résumé, so a lot of care should be put into its construction. That construction should highlight the following features:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s02_l02">
                <li>Your strengths</li>
                <li>Your responsibilities</li>
                <li>Your accomplishments</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your résumé must be completely error-free. A résumé represents you when you are not there. Recruiters look for reasons to reduce the number of résumés to review, so one error can be all that is needed to discard your résumé and your candidacy. This is true in both good and bad economies, so take great care to guarantee 100 percent accuracy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s02_p02">Proofread your résumé several times, use spell check, and ask someone who is exceptional at proofreading to review it. Always assume that an error lurks somewhere in your résumé and review it and review it and review it until you find that error! Résumés often have the following common errors:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s02_l03">
        <li>Misspellings (Spell check does not catch every misspelled word; <em class="emphasis">meat</em> will not be corrected if you meant to write <em class="emphasis">meet</em>.)</li>
        <li>Errors in verb tense (Past experiences should be written in the past tense and current experiences in the current tense.)</li>
        <li>Grammatical errors of any kind</li>
        <li>Inconsistent formatting</li>
        <li>Inappropriate length</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">How to Craft the Perfect Résumé.</strong> This is a trick title because there is no perfect résumé. You could always choose to have a particular bullet written in ways that are grammatically correct, are results oriented, and use action verbs, but writing a résumé is not a perfect science. You could show your résumé to five different recruiters and you might get five different opinions. There is no need to worry. The important thing is that it is well-written and highlights your accomplishments (no matter how big or how not so big). It’s important that the format be consistent and that you get an opinion from a professional, whether it is someone from career services, a professor, or a person who is currently working in the field in which you are most interested.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s04_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">On-Campus Recruiting.</strong> If you are participating in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">on-campus recruiting</a><span class="glossdef">Managed by a college’s career services office. Specific companies will come on campus to interview candidates. Second rounds and final rounds will follow either on campus or at the employer’s offices.</span></span> (when a company comes onto your campus to recruit), three interview scenarios are possible: open, closed, or a mixed schedule. The school dictates the type of schedule, and it’s important to know in which type you are participating:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s04_l01">
        <li>An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open schedule</a><span class="glossdef">Allows you to drop your résumé at the career services office for the specific position in which you are interested. The company recruiter will then review all the résumés and select the top ten or twelve candidates they will interview on campus (each schedule accommodates approximately twelve individuals).</span></span> allows any student to go to the career services office to drop their résumé for the specific position in which they are interested. An open schedule, therefore, is open to any candidate who wishes to be considered for an interview. The company recruiter will then review all of the résumés and select the top ten or twelve candidates they will interview on campus. (Thirty-minute interview schedules allow for twelve students to be interviewed, while forty-five-minute interview schedules allow for nine students to be interviewed.) The company will select the length of interviews when they initially book the schedule with career services.</li>
        <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">closed schedule</a><span class="glossdef">Allows the recruiter to select the ten or twelve individuals they will interview.</span></span> happens when the recruiter selects all of the ten or twelve individuals they will interview either from the résumé book, from interactions they have had on campus, or from a colleague’s recommendation. Perhaps they met a student who impressed them at a marketing event. The recruiter could choose to include that student in a closed schedule.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Half open/half closed</a><span class="glossdef">A hybrid of an open and a closed schedule.</span></span> schedules are a hybrid of the two preceding schedules. Half the students will be selected from students who have dropped their résumés, and the recruiter will select the other half from the résumé book, a recommendation, or a direct interaction with the student while they were on campus.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s04_p02">Whether you drop your résumé for an open schedule or you are selected to participate in a closed schedule, the recruiting cycle is fast paced and résumés can be easily missed due to no fault of the job seeker and résumé writer. Sometimes recruiters review hundreds of résumés to find the ten or twelve they will pursue, and sometimes résumés can be missed because of something as simple as pages sticking to one another.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s04_p03">Should your résumé be one of the many that isn’t selected, you can write to the recruiter, using your cover letter to make a strong case for why you should be considered. In some cases, this may work to get you an interview. In other cases, it will not. You can easily be passed over for no reason.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s04_p04">The recruiting process is not perfect, so it’s recommended that you apply for as many positions as possible. Never rely solely on the submission of one résumé (<a class="xref" href="ceniza_1.0-ch05#ceniza_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Step 2 (Continued): Create a Compelling Marketing Campaign, Part II: Cover Letter, Pitch, and Online Profile"</a> will give you additional strategies to get your foot in the door). Instead, when on-campus recruiting takes place, apply for all positions that fit your strengths and interests.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s05_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Off-Campus Recruiting.</strong> Don’t limit your search to only on-campus opportunities because off-campus opportunities can also be fruitful. Conducting both an on-campus and off-campus job search only increases the number of opportunities you can consider. You will want to pursue off-campus opportunities for three reasons:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s05_l01">
        <li>Your school does not have a robust career services department that attracts a variety of employers.</li>
        <li>You are interested in a company that does not recruit on campus.</li>
        <li>You want to hedge your bets to have as many opportunities as possible, representing a mix of on-campus and off-campus possibilities.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s05_p02">The main difference between on-campus and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">off-campus recruiting</a><span class="glossdef">Not managed by a college’s career services office. Instead, a candidate manages all company interaction and follow-up. Advice can still be sought from career services, however, it’s the student’s responsibility to manage the overall process.</span></span> is that in off-campus recruiting, you manage the entire process. You are responsible for getting your résumé into the hands of the company recruiters or hiring managers. You schedule the interview and follow up on your own. An off-campus job search demands that you are organized and proactive enough to keep things moving.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s00_s06_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Make an Exceptional First Impression.</strong> Your résumé will probably be the first impression a potential employer has of you and your qualifications, so it must hold their attention long enough to propel your job search forward. Use this opportunity to impress and to intrigue them enough to want to interview you. This chapter will outline multiple strategies you can employ to be seriously considered for numerous job opportunities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Your résumé can be uploaded to global <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">job boards</a><span class="glossdef">Originally used to refer to a physical board or case, often located in an employment center or agency. People looking for work might check the job board every few days to see hand-posted offers of work. This term now refers to an online job board site, where individuals can apply for positions. Two of the largest job boards are Monster and CareerBuilder, but there are hundreds of niche job board sites that focus on teaching positions, technology positions, sales positions, and so on.</span></span> like <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Monster</a><span class="glossdef">One of the largest job board sites.

It can then be shared with dozens of recruiters and hiring managers without you even knowing about it. In fact, it’s a lot easier to get your résumé in front of a recruiter than it is to have a physical presence in their office; therefore, make certain it’s a well-written, well-positioned document that makes an exceptional first impression.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">It Quantifies Your Accomplishments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_p01">The best résumés quantify results and accomplishments clearly and easily. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>If you reduced errors by 35 percent, if you increased profits by 55 percent, and if 75 percent of your customers are repeat customers, include this information clearly, succinctly, and proudly.</li>
            <li>If you have been a student teacher with thirty-five students in a classroom and student grades improved by 25 percent, include that as well.</li>
            <li>If you have worked as an administrative assistant in a dentist’s office and you are part of a marketing team that has increased new patient accounts by 10 percent last quarter, include that!</li>
            <li>If you worked in the school library and the number of lost books has declined by 50 percent, or if you provide guidance to approximately fifty students per day, that information should be in your résumé.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_p02">Quantifying your accomplishments gives your résumé readers the specific information they need to know about your abilities and to be intrigued by what you can do for them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">It Clearly States Your Abilities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">Focus on the results of your actions. Being results oriented helps résumé readers understand your abilities. What exactly do you do, or what have you done in the past? Your résumé should answer this question very quickly. For example, if you have been responsible for opening and closing a retail store on a daily basis and for managing the register that took in approximately $5,000 worth of merchandise a day, state that clearly and concisely. If you have written three to four sports articles for your school paper every month for the past three years, include that as well. The more you quantify your accomplishments, the more your abilities will be understood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">It Shows Your Command of the Written Word</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s04_p01">You don’t have to be an English major to make sure that your résumé is well-written. If your school has a career services department that offers résumé workshops, be sure to participate in them. Ask an older sibling who is in the workplace to review your résumé before it goes into cyberspace or to a future employer. Other options include asking a teacher, professor, or perhaps someone with whom you worked with or for in the past to review your résumé. Whatever the case, it is your responsibility to have a well-written résumé. You can pay for résumé-writing services, but finding someone who knows the basics of solid résumé writing may be all you need, along with this textbook. Remember that if it has one misspelled word, your résumé could easily be dismissed, along with your candidacy. It’s critical that your résumé be accurate and well written.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">It Creates Talking Points for Your Future Interviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_p01">Clearly listing your accomplishments and quantifying those accomplishments can create talking points for your future interviews. For example, perhaps your bullet point is the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_l01">
            <li>Responsible for the intake and outtake of approximately 1,000 books daily, ensuring that all library users are logged into the new electronic database, which has decreased the number of lost books by 80 percent in the past year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_p02">Many individuals have to think about the results of their work. Including this detailed information in your résumé actually allows you to easily talk about the value you’ve brought to previous employers. During an interview, with the preceding example in mind, you can easily talk about how you use technology to improve processes. You can discuss the team environment of the library staff and how you are all working toward decreasing the number of lost books. It shows that you have positively affected the bottom line by helping libraries hold onto books versus losing them, which results in unnecessary fees to library users.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">It Proves Your Worth to Your Past Employers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s06_p01">Whenever including bullet points about past work, always tie your efforts to the bottom line. Earlier examples in this chapter included the following accomplishments:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s06_l01">
            <li>Reducing errors by 35 percent</li>
            <li>Increasing profits by 55 percent</li>
            <li>Boosting repeat sales to 75 percent</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s01_s06_p02">Information relating to a company’s bottom line is exactly what employers want to read. Highlighting results like these increases your chances of having your résumé noticed.</p>

If your first name is difficult to pronounce, you could include your nickname in quotation marks or parentheses (e.g., Xioang “Angie” Kim or Massimo “Mass” Rapini). Names are typically bolded and centered on the page, but aligning your name to the right or left is also appropriate.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s03_p01">Have a professional e-mail address because employers frown upon unprofessional addresses such as greeneyes2@gmail.com or runningguy62@verizon.net. It’s best to use your first name and your last name in a simple e-mail format.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s03_p02">Establish a professional e-mail address as soon as possible (e.g., c.thompson@gmail.com or e.autoris@verizon.net). It’s much more relevant than c.thompson@rutgers.edu, especially if you graduated six months earlier. If you continue your job search after graduation, you might not be permitted to use your school e-mail address, nor should you once you have graduated. Given this, obtaining a professional e-mail address is a good networking opportunity to contact the individuals with whom you’ve been in touch regarding your job search. Inform those individuals and any relevant recruiters that you’ve updated your contact information.</p>

        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s04">

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s04_p01">Include only one phone number on your résumé and record a professional voice mail. Do not play music on your voice mail. and speak clearly and succinctly. It’s also recommended that you not answer your cell phone if you are in a loud area, especially when you do not recognize the number. Allow the call to go to voice mail, listen to it in a quiet place, and return the call as soon as possible. It very well could be a recruiter who would not be impressed by you shouting, “What? I can’t hear you!” A professional voice mail might sound like the following: “You’ve reached John Smith at 555.555.5555. Please leave a message and I will call you back as soon as possible.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s04_p02">Include your name and repeat the phone number to help the recruiter know for certain that the proper person has been reached.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Objective</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p01">Recruiters appreciate clarity, and an objective can help a recruiter understand exactly what you offer or what business would best suit your background. Objectives can be very targeted and mention a specific position or can be a bit broader in describing a job function. Whatever objective you choose, it should state what you are looking for and what you have to contribute. It’s not only about you. It’s about what you can do for them. Here are some examples of effective objectives:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>An entry-level accounting position in audit, allowing me to use my analytical and detail orientation to ensure accuracy in all reports and reviews.</li>
            <li>A communications internship at a top media company that will allow me to use my knowledge and experience to produce and edit clear and effective communications.</li>
            <li>An entry-level position in the health-care industry, enabling me to use my business and communications skills to enhance a company’s bottom line.</li>
            <li>A full-time marketing position at a <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 company, enabling me to utilize my knowledge and experience to enhance marketing efforts firm-wide.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Your objective should not ramble past two lines because no recruiter appreciates reading a paragraph-sized objective.</p>

        <li>Major and minor: You may choose to include both your major and your minor.</li>
        <li>GPA: You may include your overall GPA or you may decide to list the GPA of your major. It’s recommended that you not include your GPA if it is below 3.3. Certain industries are more concerned with GPA than others, including consulting, investment banking, and trading, which can require a 3.6 or 3.7 and above. It’s best to research each industry to better familiarize yourself with such requirements because this can vary by industry and by company.</li>
        <li>Extracurricular activities: Recruiters may be impressed to read that you were active in your college and that you belonged to targeted student clubs. If you held any leadership posts, that information should be included as well.</li>
        <li>Study abroad: If you have studied abroad, list that here. You should include the name of the university, the city and country, and the coursework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p03">Nontraditional college students (those who have significant work experience and then decide to obtain their degree) may want to list experience before education.

    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s03_p04">Here is an example of how to list your education information.</p>

        </ol>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p01">This section is arguably the most important of your résumé because most recruiters look for past work experience as a predictor of future work experience. The most conventional method of listing your work experience is in opposite chronological order (as with your education section). List your most recent job experience first and include the following information:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_l02">
        <li>The name of the company</li>
        <li>The city and state and, when outside the United States, the country</li>
        <li>The years of employment (If you’ve had several jobs at one company, include the overall years of experience, and for separate jobs, note specific years of experience.)</li>
        <li>Three to seven bullet points describing your responsibilities and the results of your work, depending on the number of years of experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p02">It’s important to use bullet points because they clearly and succinctly list your responsibilities and achievements. Recruiters do not enjoy or appreciate reading long paragraphs because they want to quickly skim the information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p03">Action verbs are helpful in this section of your résumé. You may want to consider the following words.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p04">Bullets should be results oriented and used to help quantify as many things as possible. Earlier in this chapter, we referenced the following examples:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_l03">
        <li>Reducing errors by 35 percent</li>
        <li>Increasing profits by 25 percent</li>
        <li>Boosting repeat sales to 75 percent</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p05">Here is how these items can be put into bullets:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_l04">
        <li>Reduced errors by 35 percent by creating an Excel program that immediately highlights inconsistencies when raw data are entered into the system.</li>
        <li>Increased profits by 25 percent by gathering best practices and creating a training program for all new hires.</li>
        <li>Boosted repeat sales by 75 percent by delivering the very best customer service, as evidenced by numerous satisfaction letters and comments to senior management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p06">Work experience comes in many forms. The majority of your experience will be paid, but it’s fine to include unpaid work experience. Perhaps you had an unpaid internship working in the marketing department of a magazine. Absolutely include that in your work experience. Perhaps you volunteered to help a teacher organize their classroom, and perhaps you interacted with students and helped them be prepared for the lesson plan. Include that in your work experience. The bottom line here is that through every experience, either paid or unpaid, you learn something. If you are washing cars, you learn the value of a production line: someone washes, someone rinses, and someone receives the payment. It’s fine to list work experiences such as babysitting, where your bullet could read as follows:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_l05">
        <li>Managed three to four hours of after-school activities for three children ages seven to eleven, ensuring homework was completed accurately and efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_p07">You may work in a grocery store and include the following information in your bullet:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s04_l06">
        <li>Assisted dozens of customers daily with all aspects of the store’s retail offerings, including answering questions about the locations of items and checking out customers quickly and efficiently at the register.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p01">This section of your résumé should include, but not be limited to, the following information:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Computer skills: Most employers expect Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, but include additional software knowledge (e.g., Dreamweaver).</li>
            <li>Language skills: Include your honest level of fluency (e.g., Spanish, fluent, French, beginner).</li>
            <li>Community service: Include any volunteer work, such as park clean-ups, walk-a-thons for various causes, fundraising events of any kind.  Be specific about your responsibilities and your results including: dollars raised, hours spent, leadership position, end-user experience (e.g. fund-raising efforts reached over $20K, providing for five developmentally disabled students and their parents to travel to Florida to swim with the dolphins.)</li>
            <li>Interests: This information can help to build rapport with interviewers. It’s best to keep it simple and include things that are truly of interest to you such as reading, movies, and physical fitness (in general) or tennis, football, softball (specifically). It’s true that the “Interests” section is not a core piece of information, but the vast majority of interviewers enjoy reviewing this, and the rapport you build can be helpful!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p02">You can include additional information:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_l02">
            <li>Licenses and certifications: Individuals can achieve literally hundreds of professional licenses in the areas of health care, finance, real estate, insurance, and so forth. For a complete list, Google professional licenses, and you will be able to identify if you should include any on your résumé. Examples include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)</a><span class="glossdef">To become a CFA, a person needs to take the course and pass it through the CFA Institute. This course is known to be rigorous, but you can benefit from it in the long run because you will be a respected securities professional.</span></span> Level I, Licensed Real Estate Agent, and so forth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p03">Important note: Never misrepresent any information on your résumé. If you have knowledge of another language, qualify your knowledge as fluent, intermediate, or beginner. If you don’t speak a language other than English, do not include a bullet point about language because you might not know the language capabilities of your interviewers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p04">Some résumé readers differ on this, but listing your interests can help develop rapport with your résumé reader and interviewer. No matter what the skill level of the interviewer, having a common interest can always begin a great conversation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p06">An example of information listed in this section could include the following.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p01">One of the famous last lines of a résumé is “References furnished upon request.” This is not necessary because employers can simply ask for references when they want them. However, a proactive, impressive strategy would be to create a single-page document that includes the following information:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>Your header (so it’s a matched set with the résumé), including your name, address, and contact information</li>
            <li>Your reference’s name</li>
            <li>Your reference’s company and title</li>
            <li>Your reference’s relationship to you (e.g., manager, peer, vendor, and so forth)</li>
            <li>Your reference’s contact information, including their e-mail address and phone number</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para block">Do not widely distribute this information because it contains the contact information of your references, which you should treat as confidential. However, having the list prepared enables you to quickly share this information with prospective employers upon request.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p02">Help your references help you by notifying them that they can expect a call and by highlighting the most important qualities you want them to mention.</p>

                <li>Skills and additional information add another dimension to any résumé. Recruiters should know your computer skills and any language skills you may have.

                <li>Listing your interests often helps build rapport with recruiters and interviewers.</li>
                <li>Misrepresenting your accomplishments or abilities is unethical. Many otherwise-qualified candidates often find themselves in uncomfortable positions when they have misrepresented even the slightest item on their résumé.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p01">This chapter thus far has reviewed a résumé that follows a chronological format. Another format to consider is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">functional résumé</a><span class="glossdef">As opposed to a chronological résumé, offers a different emphasis on a candidate’s accomplishments and background.</span></span>, which highlights the skills you’ve developed more than the individual jobs you’ve held.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p02">Functional résumés can be different from what most recruiters will review, so it’s best to proceed with care. This includes consulting a career services office and consulting a professional résumé writer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p03">It’s important to note that throughout the many, many years that individuals have been drafting résumés, recruiters have expected to see a chronological résumé with certain sections: employment, education, and additional information. In most cases, it’s best to give recruiters what they expect: a chronological résumé.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p04">With that understood, functional résumés can be used for college students and experienced candidates for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>Individuals may want to highlight their skills and achievements rather than the companies for which they worked.</li>
            <li>College students who do not have a strong work experience history can use a functional résumé to give them a chance to include other achievements, honors, and abilities in a very pronounced way.</li>
            <li>Experienced individuals can deemphasize gaps in employment because recruiters often notice gaps and then want those gaps explained.</li>
            <li>Experienced individuals can also deemphasize career mobility and emphasize skills and achievements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p05">Here are some categories you may want to consider when drafting a functional résumé:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_l02">
            <li>Communication skills</li>
            <li>Teamwork skills</li>
            <li>Leadership skills</li>
            <li>Honors and special achievements</li>

A CV is mostly used internationally, particularly for research-oriented positions. A CV is often longer and more detailed than a résumé. In some cases, CVs are six to eight pages long and include published material and conference information if the person presented information to colleagues. A CV may or may not include biographical information, including marital status and nationality (this is typically the case with international students studying in the United States).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s06_s02_p02">With this said, a résumé is the appropriate document when seeking any nonacademic or nonclinical position in the United States.

While rare, any anomaly should be addressed. For example, perhaps a student was ill for half a semester and didn’t graduate in the expected year. Perhaps they had an opportunity to live in another country for a prolonged period of time. A résumé will state the timeline, but the cover letter can be used for more of an explanation. It’s best to consult a professional because this situation can be a bit of a minefield.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">4.8</span> Chapter Review and Exercises</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_p01">Creating a compelling marketing campaign is a vital step in your job search because it helps you market your skills and abilities to future employers before you meet them. It’s a critical link in the six-step job search process. Take great care in creating each of the four components:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_l01">
        <li>A résumé</li>
        <li>A cover letter</li>
        <li>A pitch</li>
        <li>An online profile</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_p02">Your résumé is clearly the cornerstone of your marketing campaign because it sells your candidacy. It also serves as a one-page summary of your strengths, abilities, job responsibilities, educational background, and much more.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_p03">The more care you put into writing your résumé, the greater your chances of being noticed by the employer of your choice. The best strategies for writing a résumé are the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_l02">
        <li>Be clear, concise, completely accurate (in terms of grammar and content), and results-oriented.</li>
        <li>Quantify whatever accomplishments you can.</li>
        <li>Proofread your résumé with someone who knows what a résumé should look like and contain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_p04">It’s also important to know that while a résumé is a critical piece of your job search, it alone will not get you an interview or a job. A résumé, at best, is subjective, and different individuals have different preferences regarding format, font, length, typeface, and content. Following the guidelines of this chapter can only help position you best for success.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_p05">The remaining elements of your marketing campaign will be covered in the following chapter; each element will continue to strengthen your marketing campaign and ultimately, your job search success. Creating your compelling marketing campaign will be more effective when you are more specific, targeted, and thoughtful:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_l03">
        <li>Your résumé will prove your success to your past employers, which then proves your worth to your future employers.</li>
        <li>Your cover letter makes the case for why you should be hired because it highlights the two or three critical skills necessary to succeed in the job in which you are most interested.</li>
        <li>Your pitch allows you to introduce yourself in a clear and concise way, highlighting the strengths that will enable you to succeed.</li>
        <li>Your online profile works behind the scenes so you will be noticed by recruiters who seek talent, and also provides a great way to stay connected with your network.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Chapter Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch04_s08_l04">
            <li>A compelling marketing campaign is vital to your job search and is composed of four things: a résumé, a cover letter, a pitch, and an online profile.</li>
            <li>Your marketing campaign must have high-quality standards because it represents you when you are not there.</li>
            <li>Your résumé is the cornerstone of your marketing campaign, and it positions you for success.</li>
            <li>A well-written résumé can do seven specific things for you and your job search.</li>
            <li>A résumé should include the following sections: header, objective, education, experience, skills (computer and language, when appropriate), and additional information that may include community service, certifications, and interests.</li>
            <li>Bullets in your work experience section should outline your responsibilities and your accomplishments in a clear, results-oriented manner.</li>
            <li>Action verbs should be used to describe your responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Résumés can be presented in two formats: a chronological format and a functional format. Both have advantages and can be used by college students and more experienced candidates.</li>
            <li>A CV is very different from a résumé. CVs are used quite a bit internationally, often for research or clinical positions. CVs also can be six to eight pages in length and include biographical information such as marital status and country of origin.</li>
            <li>Recruiters are trained résumé screeners and actively look for gaps in employment, in addition to short periods of employment.</li>
            <li>Ask three or four individuals to act as references. Proactive candidates create a reference document that lists the names and contact information of people who will serve as positive references.</li>
        </ul>
