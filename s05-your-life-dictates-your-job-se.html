    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p05">Why you look for a job also influences the constraints you face when you look:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Timing and deadlines</strong>. On one extreme, you have the internship search with a tight, inflexible time frame. If you need an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">internship for credit</a><span class="glossdef">Internship where you are receiving school credit in exchange for performing the internship. The credit is usually in lieu of receiving a wage.</span></span> next semester, you either get the job by the time of registration or do not. You may need to relocate by a certain date. Your savings may be running out, so you may need to return to the workforce within a definite timetable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p07">On the other hand, you may have a job that is secure, so you can take your time with your search. You may be an ambitious freshman or sophomore with several years before you graduate and need that full-time job.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Access to resources</strong>. When you are in school, you most likely have a dedicated career services office. If you have graduated and have been out of the workforce for some time, you may have little contact with a professional network or support system. You can join an industry association, participate in networking groups, or hire a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">career coach</a><span class="glossdef">Someone who works with you on your job search. Typical activities include helping you select appropriate jobs and careers to pursue, helping with résumés and other marketing, practicing interviewing and networking, and keeping the search on track.</span></span> to help you create that professional network and support system. Your options for job search support will be different depending on where you live and how much you can invest in your search. People in busy urban areas can more easily find a chapter of a professional organization that matches their interests, like-minded people with whom to network, and career coaches and other professional support resources for hire. In a less-populated geography, you may have to rely on virtual access to professional organizations, networks, and resources. Similarly, your level of financial investment dictates which and how many organizations and networks you can join and what outside resources you can hire. Free or low-cost guidance is available from alumni associations, government agencies focused on workforce issues, and online job boards or career sites that offer guidance and expertise.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">Emotional constraints</strong>. Certain industries, such as banking and consulting, have very regimented and competitive campus recruiting seasons. Pressure is high as soon as you hit the campus. Someone returning to the workforce after a gap may feel more anxiety or fear than a job seeker with continuous employment. A career changer may feel frustrated at having to break through to a new industry or function. <a class="xref" href="#ceniza_1.0-ch01_t02">Table 1.2 "Job Search Considerations"</a> summarizes each of these considerations as it applies both to students and experienced candidates.</p>

In addition, you should continue to learn more about the company, the industry, the function, and the department in which you will work. Focus on increasing your network. Find other classmates at your school who might be involved in the same function and department as yours, and perhaps some who are joining the same industry. Join a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">LinkedIn</a><span class="glossdef">Social media site that is designed to share your professional information.</span></span> Group that focuses on your industry and your function and start a discussion. Conduct a Google Alert on your job, your industry, and your company so you are more knowledgeable about them.</p>

If it is, perhaps you can prepare ahead of time for what you will be taught. Some companies not only administer entry-level training but also grade your performance and then share your grades with your manager. You will make the best impression possible if you are ranked at the very top of your class after training.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p03">If you choose not to accept this offer, quickly launch into a search for a full-time job. Your summer internship should have let you know exactly what you liked and did not like about the company you worked with. Use that information to move your job search forward and find the company and industry you are most interested in.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p01">You’ve strengthened your résumé with a solid internship, but unfortunately, that internship did not convert to a full-time job. This is not necessarily a reflection of your internship performance. Many companies can’t predict hiring needs so far in advance that they can offer a job to a student who isn’t graduating until months or even a year into the future. It’s not the end of the world; you can still achieve your goal of receiving a full-time offer.</p>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p01">The most important thing to know at this point is why you did not receive an offer. Ask for feedback, and ask that it be specific. Recruiters and hiring managers rarely give you interview feedback because our society is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">litigious</a><span class="glossdef">Prone to litigation. A society is litigious when its people are apt to sue quickly and often.</span></span>, but your past employer should give you very specific feedback. Perhaps you need to ramp up a particular skill. Perhaps you need to be more well read on a particular topic. Troubleshooting to address any feedback you receive will help in the long run.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p02">Check with your career services office. Ensure you know exactly which companies are coming on campus during the year. Research those companies and attend their marketing events. Talk to everyone you can about opportunities and be focused on exactly what you want to do.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p03">Conduct an off-campus job search. Conducting both an on-campus and off-campus job search ensures that you consider all of the companies in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">employable universe</a><span class="glossdef">A fun way of referring to every company who is hiring.</span></span>. Remember, of course, to focus sharply on your target.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p04">When you interview for a full-time position, the interviewer may ask about your prior summer and why you did not get an offer. While answering, always speak very positively about the experience and emphasize your contributions. Given that, you need to be honest about why you did not get an offer yet at the same time not harm your candidacy. Perhaps it was not the best fit because the company focuses on a market or product outside your areas of interest. For example, perhaps you were a research intern assigned to analyze the technology industry, but you now want to focus on health care. Perhaps your internship was in the right industry but you’d rather do something else within that interest. For example, you were a talent scout, and you now want to be more involved in the technology side of moviemaking. Think of something that enhances your candidacy with the organizations you are targeting now, especially if that something is not relevant to your summer employer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p05">If you get stuck on this issue, speak to career services or a professional career coach. This could be a tricky situation and you want to avoid losing an opportunity because you didn’t have a well-thought-out response.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p03">A liberal arts education offers much to employers, including communication, research, critical thinking skills, teamwork and leadership skills, flexibility, a global focus, and many, many other skills and strengths. All of these skills can be applied to industries such as advertising, education, health care, manufacturing, media and entertainment, even areas associated with the business majors (financial services, accounting, consulting, and so forth).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p04">If you’ve studied English, history, religion, philosophy, or psychology, you have honed your critical thinking skills (for example, comparative literature), you have been innovative in your learning (for example, art history, East meets West), and your writing skills are advanced because many of these courses require extensive research reports.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_s01_p05">If you’ve studied the arts, you could be innovative, have strong presentation skills, be flexible in your thinking, and have an eye for design and graphics.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p01">You might have many reasons for not having a summer internship and not needing a full-time job. Perhaps you are graduating college and you plan to go directly into graduate school. You may not need a full-time job; however, it would be worthwhile for an aspiring law student to have a summer internship in a law firm that specializes in an area of law you find especially interesting. Perhaps you want to know what it’s like to be a litigator, and eventually a judge, so working in the court system would be a tremendous learning opportunity for you, and a tremendous networking opportunity as well.</p>

                <li>When you are graduating, you likely will have four different scenarios: you received a full-time offer from your summer employer, you did not receive an offer, you didn’t have a summer internship, and lastly, you didn’t have a summer internship and you are not looking for a full-time offer. No matter which is your situation, you can take follow-up steps to strengthen your position.</li>
                <li>Business and technical majors may have a clearer idea of what career they want by virtue of having selected a major that translates into specific careers. Liberal arts majors may not have as clear an idea, but there are ways to leverage the strength of a liberal arts education.</li>

            <li>Understand that internships are extremely helpful in your career because they support what you think you want to do, give you ideas of what you might like to do, or identify exactly what you do not want to do.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons to Pursue an Internship</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">Internships are some of the most important experiences you can have while you are in college because they either confirm the career you want or confirm the careers you know you do not want! Students can pursue internships at every stage of their college career. However, the majority of firms focus on juniors or graduate students because they are the feeder pool to a firm’s full-time hires. In some large firms in specific industries such as banking and management consulting, 80–90 percent of the summer class receive a full-time offer. The most important internship is the one you secure for the summer of your junior year or between years of graduate school because that internship will most likely result in the extension of a full-time offer. Internships are available for freshmen and sophomores but may require a bit more work to secure because companies are more prone to hiring juniors. Smaller firms or organizations still focus on juniors, but sophomores and freshman have a chance to impress as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Timing Considerations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">The most common internship is a summer internship, which lasts approximately ten weeks and begins in mid- to late May or very early June and ends in early to mid-August. The ten-week period usually begins with an orientation, and then you will be hard at work pursuing your deliverables. You may or may not have some training sprinkled throughout the ten weeks, but at the very least you should have several opportunities to network throughout the summer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">It is worth noting that some internship opportunities extend past the summer, and others are exclusively labeled fall, winter, or spring internships. Whatever the season, the experience you will garner from such opportunities can be extremely helpful to your full-time job search and will go a long way toward strengthening your résumé and value proposition to your future employer.</p>

                        <th colspan="3">Note: Certain industries have more aggressive recruiting timelines than others. For example, investment banking, sales and trading, and consulting are typically the first industries to conduct on-campus interviewing in both the fall (September and October) and the spring (January and February). All other industries typically recruit later in the academic year: technology, marketing, communications, teaching, and so forth. It’s best to check with career services, and with your classmates one or two years ahead of you, regarding this schedule, so you are best prepared. Note also that this chart represents only those companies that come to your campus to recruit. A vast number of opportunities are available, but not every opportunity will be listed with your career services office. Searches in the field of health care, teaching, and communications, to name a few, have to be managed off campus, where you are responsible for networking with decision makers, sending your marketing materials (your résumé, cover letter, and so forth), and obtaining interviews. This is challenging, but using the six-step job search process outlined in this book will help keep you on track.</th>

You might be evaluated on certain skills such as teamwork, communication, specific knowledge, and so on. Larger companies are more likely to have a formal performance review process. They sometimes share the performance metrics with you at the beginning of the summer, so there are no surprises. Some larger corporations also have other interns rate your performance because teamwork is so important. The more you know about your performance measurement, the more likely you are to succeed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p01">The best-case scenario would be to have a paid internship in your chosen field, so you can build upon the skills necessary to position yourself for a full-time job offer. However, in some industries, such as the arts, advertising, media and entertainment, public relations (PR), nonprofit, and government, unpaid internships or those that pay only a stipend are standard. In down economies, even industries that formerly offered predominately paid internships offer unpaid internships. Unpaid internships require that you receive credit for the internship. Research the credit aspect in advance. Each school produces a form or letter on school letterhead that confirms the school’s approval in advance of you receiving credit for an internship. Some organizations do not check for proper credit authorization, but many do, so it’s best to sort out credit requirements before you start your search.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_p02">Paid internships can vary from minimum wage up to a summer salary <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commensurate</a><span class="glossdef">Equal to.</span></span> with a full-time salary. Some companies pay according to your year in school, for example, some pay $10 per hour for a freshman, $12 per hour for a sophomore, $15 for a junior. The range is wide and varies by industry, size of company, role or functional area of intern, and geography, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#ceniza_1.0-ch01_s02_s04_t01">Table 1.6 "Internship Salary Differentiators"</a>.</p>

            <img src="section_05/b357d249f08fdfb886125739a210966e.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Many perfectly good reasons can explain a gap in your work history:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>unemployment, especially in a down market, where job searches take longer</li>
            <li>family leave</li>
            <li>medical leave</li>
            <li>personal leave (e.g., to travel or try something new)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p02">An employment gap raises questions about whether your skills are current, whether your industry expertise or functional knowledge is outdated, and if your network is still intact. When employers hire experienced people, it is often to use their skills right away, to take advantage of their up-to-date knowledge, and to get access to their network. If your skills, expertise, and network are questionable, and an employment gap weakens these three areas, then your value to the employer is weakened. Even if a prospective employer does not view you negatively because of a gap, all things being equal, the employer prefers a candidate with continuous work history to the one with a gap.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p03">Because most of the downside of any gap is related to the job candidate being stale or having out-of-date skills, the length of the gap is very important. A gap of several months is much more easily overcome than that of several years. Multiple gaps also might give employers the impression that your career lacks forward progress and momentum.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p04">The reason for the gap is also important. If you attribute the gap to being unable to find a job, the employer may question how desirable you are to its competitors. If the gap is for family leave, the employer may wonder if you are fully committed. If medical reasons kept you from working, the employer can legally only verify you are able to do the job in question, but this doesn’t mean the employer won’t wonder silently if you will be at your best. Finally, if your gap is due to personal pursuits, the employer may wonder if you are truly back for good or just biding time until your next adventure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Take Control of the Message behind Your Gap</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p01">The more an employer wonders what’s behind your employment gap, the more negatively they might view your circumstances. You must be specific and deliberate in how you message the reasons behind your gap.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Be empowered about your choice to leave</strong>. When you talk about why you took time off, don’t sound sheepish. Don’t denigrate your experience. If it was a layoff, employers aren’t expecting you to be happy about being laid off, but you should, at the very least, stay composed and matter-of-fact. Simply state there was a layoff. Then move the conversation onto the present in a positive manner. Reiterate your interest in the current opportunity, rather than showing regret, anger, or any other lingering connection with your previous employer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p03">If your leave was medically related, you do not need to give details. Simply state you had a medical issue that needed to be taken care of, but, thankfully, you are well now! A future employer welcomes hearing that type of message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Give detailed examples of what you accomplished and learned</strong>. If your gap is due to a layoff, don’t talk about your job search activity as the sole focus of your time. Talk about how you are keeping your skills and network current. Talk about what you’ve read recently as a signal that you are keeping abreast of the industry. Stress the positive in all that you have been doing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Translate your time off into experience your prospective employer will appreciate</strong>. If you took a family leave, don’t focus on your parenting skills unless you are interviewing for a relevant position with children. Focus on how you coordinated playgroups, which shows organization, management, and attention to detail. Mention your fund-raising for school programs, which shows sales skills. If you took a leave to pursue a personal interest, make a case for how that experience contributes to your next role, for example, extensive travel might translate to international awareness and cross-cultural savvy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p06">Whatever the reason behind your gap, position it in a positive, optimistic, forward-thinking way. Perhaps the gap gave you the perfect opportunity to redirect your career to exactly what you are now most interested in. Use the reasons for your gap to make the case for why you are a strong candidate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p07">If you are having a tough time explaining a gap of any kind, find a resource, such as your school’s career services office, mentor, or coach to help you craft a meaningful, impactful message.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p01">Are you 100 percent convinced that you are ready to return to the workforce after your time away? If you are looking for a return job to be a place where you can learn on someone else’s payroll, then you are not making the most compelling case for why a prospective employer should hire you. Get ready to work before you return to work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p02">Make sure your skills, expertise, and network are up to date. Use Excel to maintain your household budget so you can keep that skill up to date. Read trade journals dedicated to your industry and functional area. Join professional associations in your industry and functional area. You may want to volunteer so that you update your skills, expertise, and network in a working environment. These suggestions are useful to everybody in the job search, but for a candidate with a gap in employment, maintenance of your skills, expertise, and network is even more critical.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p03">Make sure you have the financial cushion to sustain a longer search. It may take a while to rebuild your skills, expertise, and network and to convince prospective employers this has occurred. You may want to take temporary or project work even in an area unrelated to your target field to ensure you can support your financial obligations during your search.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p04">Do you show the confidence that results from being 100 percent convinced you are ready to return to the workforce after your time away? If you doubt your own skills, it will be difficult to convince others. Make sure that you work on your story, examples, and reasons for why you are the best candidate for your target job.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p05">If you are just settling back into your field after time away, your personal support network might have fallen away. You might not have a daily routine in place that keeps you motivated and active. Make sure you rebuild your environment to support your job search. Professional associations, networking groups, alumni chapters, mentors, or coaches may help with your confidence and emotional support.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p06">If you have unresolved personal issues or extreme anxiety, frustration, or other emotional constraints, then you might consider enlisting a therapist or counselor to help you deal with these issues. Remember that it is not just the tactical issues of your job search that need care and attention. Make sure you tend to your emotional needs.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p01">In a way, we are all career changers because the transition from school to work is a career change. You have a different role (from student to whatever your new job is). You are in a different environment (unless your new employer is an institute of higher education). You might even be in a different geography because many people go to school in a different place from where they settle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p02">Sometimes the career change is more pronounced, such as an executive who decides after decades of experience that she wants to try something new. Martha Stewart’s early jobs were in financial services, not hospitality. You may have built up your expertise and accomplishments in an area very different from where you want to be working.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Changing Careers Is Different from Changing Jobs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p01">When you change jobs, you do essentially the same role in the same industry. If you are a hotel concierge for a Hilton property and then move to a Sheraton hotel, this is a job change. If you are a hotel concierge for Hilton and become an office manager for an architecture firm, this is a career change—you are doing a different role in a different industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p02">In the subsequent chapters on job search, you need to execute the same six steps as other job seekers. In the areas of marketing yourself and talking about yourself in networking and interviewing situations, however, you won’t be able to rely on your past track record for examples or evidence of how you are suitable for the job. This doesn’t mean you should simply ask prospective employers to take a leap of faith and trust that you will learn. Instead, you should do enough preparation that you fit in with the new area you are targeting.</p>

    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Changing Careers Successfully Means You Look Like You Aren’t Changing Careers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p01">Essentially, you want to make yourself equal to someone already doing the job, so you don’t want to appear like a career changer, but rather already a career insider. While you might not have a specific employment situation to point to, you can develop the skills and expertise of an insider by volunteering or consulting in that new job area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p02">A student might point to her work as a tutor when she interviews with schools for teaching positions. An aspiring marketer might highlight his role in the advertising campaign for his school’s homecoming event. A more experienced executive who doesn’t have the campus opportunities of clubs and extracurricular activities can look at community organizations for opportunities to volunteer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p03">As you go along the six-step job search process, pay close attention to Step 3, Conduct In-Depth Research.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changing Careers Requires Additional Search Skills Compared to Changing Jobs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01">Career changers have more convincing to do and need additional search skills. This means that the career changer’s job search will be different:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">It will likely take longer</strong>. You have to establish a track record in your new area. You have to find people who will listen to your story. Students should start their job search long before graduation. They can use the years in school to build a track record in areas where they might want to work after graduation. In the six-step job search process, step 5 includes strategies for maintaining long-term motivation, which also would be particularly helpful when changing careers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">It may be more expensive</strong>. A longer search means that you have no money coming in from your new job. If you have another job while you are looking, that might be fine, but if you are unemployed you have to factor in enough cash to last throughout the longer search.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">It might require additional education or training</strong>. Depending on the new job requirements, you might need a specific degree or certification you don’t already have. Experienced professionals might consider taking advantage of tuition benefits at their current employer to learn new skills while still at their old career. Students should look at specific courses they can take before graduation to enhance their marketability.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">You have to hustle more</strong>. Because you don’t have the track record in other workplaces, your résumé won’t demonstrate a track record. If all prospective employers know about you is your résumé, you likely will not be seen. Therefore, you must network and get in front of people to have a chance to tell your story. In the six-step job search process, step 4 focuses on networking and interviewing, which will help with the hustling, as well as crafting a compelling story about your career change.</p>

                <li>Changing careers is different from finding a new job in the same area, but we have all done it at least once, when we moved from school to the workplace.</li>
                <li>Changing careers requires you to convince prospective employers that you can do the job even though you don’t have a track record at another workplace.</li>
                <li>Making a compelling case is easier when you are already doing the job (e.g., as a volunteer or consultant) and have the skills, expertise, and network in your new area.</li>
                <li>Having additional search resources and skills will help you successfully execute a career change. You need more time, more money, more (or different) credentials, and more hustle.</li>

If the answers you get are not areas of interest, list related courses you can take or experiences you can get before you graduate.</li>
                <li>If you are an experienced professional considering a career change, map your existing résumé to a job description in the area you are targeting. What is missing? Make a list of action items with a timetable for how you can fill in the gaps.</li>
                <li>If you have assumed that you need specific job experience or a specific degree, call a professional association for your area of interest and ask about typical member profiles. Check your assumptions before adding items to your to-do list, especially additional schooling.</li>

            <img src="section_05/6a4ee65c9d6739e9229d96e67aabfb3a.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">You might be attending school in a location that is different from where you want to live after graduation. You might have personal reasons for wanting to relocate now. You might want to experience working in a different country. A number of positive explanations might exist for why you need to conduct a long-distance job search. This doesn’t make it any less challenging:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Your network and support system may be smaller</strong>. Your contacts are more likely to be where you live. In the case of a long-distance search, you won’t have as big or strong a network in your target geography.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">You have additional planning and scheduling constraints due to travel</strong>. You need to travel to your target geography several times during your search. Phone interviews and networking meetings are fine to start, but you absolutely have to meet people in person during your search. Planning and accommodating travel into your schedule are concerns you must address if you are a job seeker who is relocating.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Your long-distance search can be expensive</strong>. Some employers will pay for interview travel, but even then, only at the later stages of an interview. For networking or exploratory interviews, you need to foot the bill. In addition, some but not all employers pay for relocation. National conferences or career fairs in your target geography give you a chance to meet and possibly interview with prospective employers. You need to budget and plan for the fees and travel accompanying these resources.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">If you are relocating internationally, you have the added complexity of different time zones, different currencies, different employment laws, and different job search protocols</strong>. Imagine a search for someone in Asia wanting to work in the United States or vice versa—even the simplest phone call needs to be planned due to the time difference. When you research salaries or even company or industry revenues, you will be dealing with a different currency. You also have to check how you will be classified when working abroad—sometimes you can be paid in your home currency. You need to research what visa or other authorization you need to work in a different country. Finally, your job search tactics need to take into account cultural norms abroad.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p06">For those students who wish to return to their home country, perhaps you have friends and family who can help to make connections. You will want to use your time wisely when you travel back home during breaks and holidays, and arrange interviews and meetings far in advance. International students who want to stay in the United States after graduation are presented an entirely new set of issues. Obtaining permanent authorization to work in the United States can be complex because the government has caps on work permits that are often reached by the vast number of international students who want to stay in the United States. In addition, certain visas allow for one year of work in the United States (H1B), and extensions can come with those visas. Students should speak to the person in charge of international students or to career services for advice on these issues. You might also consult an employment lawyer who is well versed in visa requirements. A good job search strategy would include researching and then targeting companies that will hire international students who are not authorized to work in the United States on a full-time basis.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Searching Long-Distance Requires Extra Time, Expense, and Activities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p01">You still need to execute the six steps of the job search process, but with these additions:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Plan time and budget to visit your target geography several times over the course of your search</strong>. If you are a student, consider using your academic breaks in your target geography. If you are employed, set aside vacation time to make these trips. Budget for these additional travel expenses as you plan your job search.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Set specific dates for when you will be in the target geography</strong>. It is helpful if prospective employers know when you will be in the area. You might convince employers or at least networking targets to meet with you because you are rarely in the area.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Make sure you are clear about time zones</strong>. You want to correspond during normal business hours for your target. If you are in the United States and targeting Asia, this means you have late-evening search activities. When you are scheduling within a different time zone, be vigilant about expressing what time zone you are referring to when you propose or confirm times.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Research visa, work authorization, and other legal issues as soon as your target geography is identified</strong>. Paper work often takes longer to process than you expect, and you do not want to find out you have expended effort for an inaccessible location. Remember to consult with international student affairs, career services, or an employment lawyer well before you start your search.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Research cultural nuances and exactly how the job search is conducted in the geography you are targeting</strong>. This might be obvious for international searches, but there might also be nuances in different regions of the same country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Account for extra time to be deliberate in your search</strong>. When you are in a different geography, you will not have the luxury to drop in at a networking event you heard about at the last minute. Conferences and career fairs have deadlines for registration. The immediate people around you will likely not be connected to your target geography. You will need to be proactive and find resources relating to your long-distance search.</p>

    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Consider Moving before You Get a Long-Distance Job</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p01">Employers do not want to waste their time on candidates who then decide not to move. If you have a specific date for when your move will happen, this helps convince prospective employers how serious you are about moving. If you offer to pay for your interview travel, this also signals to employers that you are serious about their geography. (Employers don’t always pay for interview travel, anyway.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p02">Some job seekers might make their move contingent on getting a job in the area, and financially, this may make sense, but it presents the chicken-and-egg problem: employers want to know you will definitely move before they consider hiring you, but you want to know they will give you a job before you consider moving. People do get jobs before they have physically moved. However, if your job search has stalled, you might want to consider moving to your target geography because it is easier to look for a job in the same place you live.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p03">Getting an address or phone number that reflects your future geography can signal to employers that you are already there. This helps you with employers who won’t consider out-of-area candidates. However, this may hurt your chances for relocation reimbursement if you need to move for the job and would otherwise have qualified had you not suggested you were already there.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p04">Even hypothetically planning the move will help you personally, as it confirms whether you can indeed move. If you own a home, can you sell it in a timely way? Have you run the numbers on relocation costs and your new cost of living in the target geography? Are you emotionally prepared to uproot? It’s one thing to imagine that you would be open to relocating, but once you are in the thick of your job search, you want to be sure that you are spending time on geographies that are feasible options for you.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">1.6</span> Chapter Review and Exercises</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s06_p01">This book will give you the tools necessary to execute any kind of job search you need at any point in your life. A successful job search begins with understanding your current life situation. Knowing your goals and how each job can help you reach those goals is critical to your confidence and emotional level during a job search. Your current life situation and the reason for your job search represent the variables in your search. The six-step job search process that is covered in the subsequent chapters represents the constant, or the framework, from which you launch your search.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s06_p02">Whether you are a student interested in a summer internship or your first full-time job or an experienced professional returning from a leave or changing careers, this book gives you a job search methodology to get that next job.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s06_p03">There is much to consider when making a change of any kind in your life and career. Timing is important, such as campus recruiting deadlines or a specific moving date. Timing is a factor in another sense for individuals with gaps of employment on their résumé. Access to resources varies over time because you may be a student with great career services support or out of the professional workplace on a leave and feeling more isolated. Emotions vary because some job searches are more stressful than others: the regimented campus recruiting programs of banking and consulting firms; the career changer looking to fit in; the unemployed worker under a cash crunch.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s06_p04">Remember that your job search changes depending on your specific life situation. Knowing that your life influences your job search, adapt your strategy accordingly. Maximize your inherent advantages. Minimize any constraints.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Chapter Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_s06_l01">
            <li>You can find yourself conducting a job search at multiple times in your college career. In your freshman, sophomore, and junior years, you will be searching for internships. The internship of your junior year can lead to a full-time job offer.</li>
            <li>While in college, you should know about and adhere to a recruiting schedule because it can facilitate getting internships and full-time jobs more easily.</li>
            <li>Liberal arts majors, by nature of a wide curriculum, may have a more difficult time deciding what career will be best for them. A liberal arts education affords many strengths that can be used in a job search, when positioned properly.</li>
            <li>Summer internships can be structured or unstructured. The most structured internships include an orientation and performance reviews, with multiple performance measurements.</li>
            <li>Gaps in your employment history can affect your hiring potential, but that risk is mitigated when you explain them strategically.</li>
            <li>Career changes are possible when you bridge the gap with skills you have developed in your current job with those same skills needed in your desired job.</li>
            <li>Long-distance job searches can be complex and you need to budget time and effort to execute them successfully. International job searches are even more complex because you need to take into account different time zones and different employment laws.</li>
