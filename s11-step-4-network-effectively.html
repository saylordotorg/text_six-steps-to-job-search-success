        <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
        <p class="simpara">Networking Effectively is Crucial to Your Job Search</p>
        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_p01">In this textbook, we have completed the first three steps in a job search:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_l01">
            <li>Identify your target.</li>
            <li>Create a Compelling marketing campaign.</li>
            <li>Research.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_p02">The next step is Step 4: Networking and Interviewing. The two are combined because they are complementary: the more effectively you network, the more effectively will your efforts result in an interview. In addition, networking can also be considered a mini-interview because the more you impress a contact, the more likely it is that person will help you secure a real interview. For the purposes of this chapter, however, we’ll focus on networking only and <a class="xref" href="ceniza_1.0-ch08#ceniza_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Step 4 (Continued): Master the Interview"</a> will focus on interviewing only.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Definition of Networking.</strong> You can look up the word “networking” in many dictionaries, and you’ll find many different definitions. One of the best definitions for networking comes from an extremely talented speaker and business coach, Bob Burg, who defines it as such:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s01_p02">“Networking is defined as establishing a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship of give and take, with the emphasis on the give.”<span class="footnote" id="ceniza_1.0-fn07_001">Bob Burg, "Endless Referrals" (lecture, East Elmhurst, NY, October 22, 2008).</span></p>
    <div class="informalfigure large medium-height block">
        <img src="section_11/1a9fc104d16450bfb2965b8b9d9f3d8f.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s01_p03">This is an exceptional definition for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s01_l01">
        <li>Relationships are to be established for the long term, throughout your college years and business career.</li>
        <li>Relationships should be mutually beneficial because such relationships are more likely to be sustained.</li>
        <li>Relationships in networking emphasize the give versus the take. This may not seem <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intuitive</a><span class="glossdef">Something that is natural, something that is sensed.</span></span> because we network to get a job—right? Wrong. Focusing only on getting a job gives networking and you a bad reputation. Focusing on the other person’s interests and pursuits will build a network for you that will always be there when you need something.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s01_p05">Another <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">universal truth</a><span class="glossdef">Something that is true all of the time, in every instance.</span></span> is that the more you give, the more you will get. A genuine quality of giving will separate you from other networkers. Being genuinely interested in finding out about a person and wanting to know them well enough to positively affect their career, their lives, and their interests is a huge differentiator.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Quality, Not Quantity!.</strong> Networking isn’t about quantity; it’s about quality. We all know more people than we realize and we have numerous opportunities to meet new people every day. Just don’t forget that after you meet someone, unless you maintain and expand that relationship, that person isn’t really part of your core network. Networking isn’t just about approaching people; it’s about following up.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Power of Networking.</strong> People naturally want to network with people who they know, like, and trust. Once these criteria have been met, people will generally open their networks up to you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_p02">It’s a given that one person knows 250 people, give or take. Most people could invite about 250 people to their wedding and have approximately 250 visitors at their funeral.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_p03">If you know, like, and trust another individual, and therefore open your network up to that person, they will have access to a network of 500 individuals:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">their 250 contacts + your 250 contacts = 500 contacts</span></span>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_l01">
        <li>Multiply 500 by 10 people, and you will now have access to 2,500 individuals.</li>
        <li>Multiply 2,500 by 100 people, and you will now have access to 25,000 individuals.</li>
        <li>Multiply 25,000 by 250 people, and you will now have access to 625,000 individuals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_p04">Your need to know 250 people might be intimidating, but let’s start with about 100 people you may know:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_l02">
        <li>Friends</li>
        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Schoolmates (fraternity, sorority, athletes, classmates)</li>
        <li>Professors, teaching assistants, school administrators, coaches</li>
        <li>Past and current coworkers</li>
        <li>School reunion attendees</li>
        <li>Neighbors</li>
        <li>Owners of neighborhood businesses (deli, coffee shop, dry cleaners, hardware stores, and so forth)</li>
        <li>People with whom you have volunteered</li>
        <li>People from a religious organization to which you belong</li>
        <li>Societies you might want to join that provide information about careers that are meaningful to you (e.g., Public Relations Student Society of America, National Society of Hispanic/Black MBAs, Society of Human Resources Professionals, Society of Speech and Drama Professionals, Society of Tennis Medicine, Society of Pharmacists)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_p05">In addition to who you know now, this chapter will give you strategies for building more networking contacts. Some useful venues include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_l03">
        <li>Family events (weddings, birthdays, barbeques, and so forth)</li>
        <li>Alumni events (great opportunities to network with professionals with whom you have something in common)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s03_p06">The power of networking is limitless. Most individuals will use LinkedIn.com to keep in contact with their networks. Some individuals are open networkers and will connect with anyone who wants to connect with them. Others will be more discriminating and connect only to those people they know well. Either way, it’s a huge benefit to keep in touch with your contacts when they move from company to company and as they change e-mail addresses. It’s estimated that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Generation Y</a><span class="glossdef">Anyone born between 1980-1995.</span></span> (anyone born between 1980-1995) will change jobs close to twenty times in their lifetime. Keeping in touch with individuals this way can be very convenient and beneficial.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s04_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Benefits of Networking.</strong> Networking has countless benefits. Aside from the social benefits of building relationships and keeping in touch with friends and valued acquaintances, networking yields other advantages:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s04_l01">
        <li>You will have insider information before things are public knowledge. This could pertain to the right companies to join or the right departments to consider. Often, before jobs are even posted, your networking contacts can let you know of opportunities.</li>
        <li>You will have access to individuals you otherwise might never meet or get to know, and your reach will extend to opportunities others may not ever hear of.</li>
        <li>You will know news before it reaches the general public, thus increasing your credibility.</li>
        <li>You might get the opportunity to lead others in your field. You could participate in a panel discussion or on a task force.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s00_s04_p02">Networking enhances our lives in many ways. You can meet interesting people who share their life experiences, you can gain access to information you may never have known, and you can have access to career opportunities that otherwise would be out of your reach. The more effectively you network, the more opportunities will be presented to you. This chapter will outline strategies to build and expand your network so those opportunities are within your reach.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.1</span> The Four Stages of Networking</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_l01">
            <li>Learn the four stages of networking and why you need to follow the steps sequentially.</li>
            <li>Learn why follow-up could be the most important component of all four stages of networking.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_p01">Networking consists of four stages, and the sequential order of the four stages is extremely important:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_l02">
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>The approach</li>
        <li>The follow-up</li>
        <li>The request</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_p02">We all know individuals who call us only when they need something. They use only two of the four steps: they go from the approach right to the request. We know how we feel when this happens. When these people contact us, we no doubt say to ourselves, “I wonder what they want now.” To avoid this annoying behavior, you must follow the four steps sequentially. Let’s review each one in the order they should be used.</p>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Research enables you to identify key things and key people with whom you should be networking. In a job search, you should aim your research to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>What details are available about the company of interest?</li>
            <li>What specific departments exist within the company?</li>
            <li>Who are the individuals who run those departments (the decision makers)?</li>
            <li>Does this company recruit on campus?</li>
            <li>Does HR lead the company’s recruiting efforts, or do the hiring managers find their own talent (for the most part)?</li>
            <li>What is the profitability of each department?</li>
            <li>What companies compete against the main company and against the specific departments (they might be different)?</li>
            <li>What are the top products and services produced?</li>
            <li>What are the goals of the company or the department?</li>
            <li>What recent challenges and trends are they are experiencing?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p02">Once you identify these items, research everything about them through company websites, Google, LinkedIn, and the people in your network. The more information you gather, the more knowledgeable you will be about your job search, and the more likely you will impress those with whom you meet and network.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Approach</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Once you have identified the individuals with whom you would like to network or contact, think about how you would like to contact them. Great care should be taken with this step because first impressions matter. Things to consider include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>
                <p class="para">Do you know anyone who can make a <em class="emphasis">warm</em> introduction? Cold contacts are clearly not as effective as an introduction from someone who knows both parties. If you are fortunate enough to have such a contact, approach them to make the connection. Never ask for a job. Instead, ask that they make an introduction. People you already know can make introductions:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_l02">
                    <li>Friends and family</li>
                    <li>Current or past employees of the company (this includes classmates who have interned at companies of interest)</li>
                    <li>Peers at school</li>
                    <li>Career services</li>
                    <li>Other school contacts, including professors, administrators, and so on</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you must make a <em class="emphasis">cold</em> contact, your research can be used to impress. In a cover letter, you may write intelligently and compellingly about how you can be instrumental in the company because you can do x, y, or z. Be specific about your knowledge of the company, the departments, and the company’s competitors. Know why another company is challenging them, or why they are clearly the industry leader with no close second. Refer to <a class="xref" href="ceniza_1.0-ch05#ceniza_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Step 2 (Continued): Create a Compelling Marketing Campaign, Part II: Cover Letter, Pitch, and Online Profile"</a>, part II of this textbook, for complete information on how to write a compelling cover letter.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reconnect with Old Contacts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p01">If you have great contacts, but you haven’t kept in touch with them, you can use different ways to reconnect, but take care to not offend. The first time you reconnect, it cannot be about your job search. You cannot ask for anything that first time, except how the other person is doing. The point of reconnecting is to reestablish the relationship. The other person is the focus and by listening to them and being interested, you actually help yourself because you will learn about what’s going on in the market and what people care about, and you can act on this <em class="emphasis">later</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p02">This is why maintaining your network is so critical when you don’t need anything. It takes the time pressure off you to accomplish anything. If, however, you have waited until you are in need to work on your network, then you must discipline yourself to make those early contacts about your network and not about yourself. One good exercise is to take three to five contacts per day and just say hello. This gets you in the habit of regularly reaching out to your network, so that when you actually have a question to ask or even a favor, the request isn’t the only time you have reached out.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p03">When using LinkedIn, remind people how you know each other. Don’t use those template connection invitations. Compose a personal message about where you met, when you last spoke, or something else that shows genuine interest. Add an updated and professional-looking picture of yourself so that old connections who may have forgotten your name can recognize you visually.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Follow-Up</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p01">A networking <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paradox</a><span class="glossdef">A seemingly contradictory statement that may nonetheless be true.</span></span> is that you cannot get a job without networking, but the biggest networking pet peeve is when someone asks for a job. Remember that no one wants to be contacted only in times of need. That’s what gives networking a bad reputation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p02">Once you have made the contact, the very next step is to follow up and maintain the networking contact. Immediately after meeting someone, following either a marketing event of some kind, a networking meeting, or an interview, you should send that person an e-mail that mentions that you were happy to see or meet them, references something you discussed (to at the very least remind them of your conversation), and asks for nothing in return.</p>
        <p class="para block">Recruiters and hiring managers appreciate e-mails that reiterate interest or share an item that may be of interest to them, but what isn’t appreciated is requiring that they get back regarding a date or detail of some kind. Avoid if it at all possible. The best way to build a solid network is to contact people when you don’t need anything. Even if you are a job seeker and are networking to jump-start your search, you don’t want your first contact (or even your second) to be a request for help. Instead, maintain (or restart) your network by reaching out to people regularly—without asking for anything.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p03">If you plan to add someone to your network for the long term, you should follow up with that person several times a year. Asking for help or just talking about yourself doesn’t count. Follow up in a way that focuses on them and what you can do for them, not the other way around. Focus on giving away—not selling. Here are some creative ways to reach out:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Say thank you</em>: Thank them for their time in meeting with you, and for the information they shared. Add something you discussed to the thank-you note to support the fact that you were listening and comprehending. Set the stage for future networking contact.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Give a results update</em>: If someone gave you advice, let them know what you did with it. Perhaps someone made a connection that resulted in another connection. Keep them updated and thank them again for the connection.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Spread holiday cheer</em>: Send holiday cards, and include some information about yourself to keep people updated. Remember to note information you receive in return (e.g., changes of address, changes of employment). Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year’s Day, Easter, the Fourth of July, Passover, Memorial Day, and Thanksgiving are great times to keep in touch, but you might even use the arrival of spring as a reason to reach out.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Announce a life change</em>: You might announce the end of the school year, entrance to an internship, entry to a graduate degree program, a promotion, or just an e-mail change. When you send out announcements, include news about other areas of your life. Always be upbeat. Job seekers can let their network know they are looking in specific industries, but shouldn’t immediately ask for help. For job seekers who have already announced they are looking, consider a follow-up contact letting people know where you are in your search.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Offer an interesting article</em>: Pick something about their industry and company, and it shows you are on top of news that matters to them. This works well for professional contacts, with whom you may not be on a familiar enough basis for a holiday card or personal announcement. An insightful article lets the contact know you are thinking of them and you understand what’s important in their industry.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Introduce a new contact</em>: When you introduce people to your network, not only do you expand the contacts of the person you introduce, but you also get an opportunity to catch up with your network. Like sending an interesting article, an interesting referral lets the contact know you are knowledgeable about their needs and willing to help.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Simply say hello</em>: Sometimes a person just pops into your head. Maybe they resemble someone on TV. Maybe you heard a joke they would enjoy. Follow your instinct and call or e-mail to say hello. It is always nice to know people are thinking of you.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Offer congratulations</em>: Did they make one of those business magazine top lists (e.g., Most Innovative, Most Admired, Best Places to Work)? If you hear good news about someone or their company, point it out.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Make a recommendation</em>: If you read a good book, try a good restaurant, and so forth, pass that on. (Make sure to keep it professional because your referrals are always a reflection on you.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p04">Use these nine methods, timed six to seven weeks apart, and you have almost a year of follow up. Now you have no excuse not to maintain your network.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s01_s04_p01">Only when you have completed the first three steps should you make a request. The quality of your network depends on following this checklist. It is tempting to jump from step 2 (the approach) to step 4 (the request), but you do so at the risk of not building a quality network on which you can rely for your professional success.</p>

                <li>Networking has four distinct stages. Effective networkers shouldn’t take shortcuts.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_p01">Earlier in this textbook (in chapter 5) the networking pitch was covered extensively. A shortened version is included here.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_p02">A networking pitch was originally termed an elevator pitch because in the time an elevator takes to go between floors (generally thirty to forty seconds), you should be able to articulate your value proposition (the skills you have and the position you are seeking). The elevator pitch is now also called the professional pitch, the networking pitch, or simply, the pitch.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_p03">An pitch is crucial to your job search: it’s a thirty second introduction and overview of what you are about, including your education, your work experience, and your unique value proposition. Typically, it’s also your first chance to impress. You can also use it in a variety of ways:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_l02">
        <li>Whenever you meet someone new in person or by phone</li>
        <li>At the very beginning of an interview, to give an overview of your background</li>
        <li>As an introduction during networking events (mostly business, but some personal as well)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_p04">This thirty- to forty-second summary should be spoken, or delivered, in a confident, convincing manner, making a strong impression. If your pitch is too long and drawn out, it lacks <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conviction</a><span class="glossdef">To have purpose.</span></span>. When meeting networking contacts, recruiters, and hiring managers, this is your one chance to make a great impression and present yourself with clarity. No one wants to listen to a long, drawn-out speech. A pitch should be clear and concise, enabling the person who is listening to know exactly what type of job search candidate you are.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_p05">How do you craft an effective pitch? Three steps will ensure your success:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_l03">
        <li>Write your pitch.</li>
        <li>Edit your pitch until it sounds just right.</li>
        <li>Practice delivering your pitch verbally, and edit it further as needed because we don’t write the same way that we speak. Continue rehearsing and repeating your pitch to ensure that your delivery is natural, convincing, and authentic.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Write Your Pitch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p01">Your pitch should answer the following five questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">What is your educational background</em>? Detail every college or university you attended, your major and minor, and your expected degree and graduation month and year (include your GPA if it’s 3.3 or higher).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Do you have any pertinent experience in the field in which you are interested</em>?</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">What are your critical skills and strengths</em>? Highlight your top two or three skills.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">What do you want to do</em>? Be specific regarding industry, function, and geography (see <a class="xref" href="ceniza_1.0-ch03#ceniza_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Step 1: Identify Your Job Search Targets"</a>).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Why would you be good at the position</em>? Focus on presenting your top two or three skills, and the skills you have that are necessary to succeed at the job you are targeting.</li>

    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Edit Your Pitch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Once your pitch is in writing, review it and edit it accordingly. You should use words that come naturally to you because the more natural the delivery, the more impressive the pitch. Here are some steps you can consider while editing your pitch:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>After you edit the one-page answers to the pitch questions, ensuring that you have covered all the important items, cut it to half a page; this forces you to prioritize the essential elements.</li>
            <li>After you edit the half-page document, ensuring that you have covered all the important items, cut it in half again (it’s now one-quarter of the page); this forces you to be even more ruthless in prioritizing.</li>
            <li>After you edit the quarter-page document, ensuring you have covered all the important items, cut it in half again, leaving only four or five key bullets; this forces you to be concise and select just the most important items.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Practice Delivering Your Pitch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p01">Once you have the final pitch in writing, you’ll need to practice, then practice, then practice some more. Your pitch should be spoken in a confident and compelling manner.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>Review your pitch to ensure it flows smoothly and addresses your career highlights, and then practice it until it’s memorized. Practice until you can repeat it when someone shakes you from your sleep at 3:30 in the morning and you can maintain your passion when saying it.</li>
            <li>Using an accurate stopwatch or timer and a tape recorder (or answering machine) to record yourself, repeat the preceding exercise. Start with two minutes, then cut it to one minute, then cut to it thirty seconds, and, finally, cut it to fifteen seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p02">The trick to a successful pitch is to practice it ten, twenty, thirty, even forty times. Practice until it rolls off the tip of your tongue. Practice until it has your exact tone and style. Practice until it’s such a natural thing to say that you don’t even have to think about it before and while you are saying it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Great networkers build their networks every day, while keeping in touch with those they have already met. Net<strong class="emphasis bold">work</strong>ing is <strong class="emphasis bold">work</strong>, but the rewards far outweigh the effort you will expend.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p02">The most effective way to build a network is to have a genuine interest in every person you meet. Most individuals know when someone wants to know them for what they offer versus wanting to know them for what they can gain from the relationship. Don’t fall into that self-serving trap. Genuine interest in others is the impetus for building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships of give and take, with the emphasis on the give.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p03">If you are just beginning to build your network, or if you want to expand the network you already have, consider the following exercise:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p04">Notice that the horizontal axis is relevance to job search. As you go from left to right, the relevance to your job search becomes stronger. Willingness to help is on the vertical axis; as you go higher, the willingness to help is greater.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p05">Logically, you will want to expand your network with the people who represent the characteristics in quadrant II: high willingness to help and high relevance to your job search. These individuals include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Career services directors, career counselors, administrators</li>
            <li>Peers with whom you have good relationships and who could perhaps share information about their prior internships</li>
            <li>Professors who are impressed with your abilities and performance and who have ties to corporations of interest to you</li>
            <li>Alumni who want an increasing number of qualified candidates from their school to enter their company or industry</li>
            <li>Past employers who were very satisfied with your level of work, who have contacts at firms in which you are interested in, and so forth</li>
            <li>Your relative who works in a corporation, but not in your industry, who may be friends with those who do work in your industry</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p06">Logically, you will want to spend the least amount of time with people in quadrant III because they have no relevance to your job search and are not willing to help.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p07">Quadrants I and IV remain, and very helpful networking contacts could be lurking in both of these populations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p08">Quadrant I: This is an excellent resource for networking contacts because these individuals are very willing to help, but perhaps their relevance to your job search isn’t obvious or apparent. You never know who people know, so it’s very much worth your while to get to know as many people as you can, no matter what the venue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p09">People in quadrant I include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_l02">
            <li>A neighbor might be best friends with an administrative assistant at the company in which you are interested and that assistant could easily share your résumé with hiring managers.</li>
            <li>Someone with whom you are affiliated by attending a church, synagogue, or any other place of worship may have contacts in the industry in which you are interested, and can arrange for an informational interview.</li>
            <li>Your landscaper might have a brother who is a senior or top-level executive at the exact company in which you are interested.</li>
            <li>A diner owner could have a close friend who is a hospital administrator and can arrange an introduction into the health-care field.</li>
            <li>A teacher’s husband might be a vendor to the company in which you are interested.</li>
            <li>Your dog groomer might have a neighbor who is a junior-level manager at a firm of interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p10">The endless possibilities in this quadrant shouldn’t be overlooked!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p11">Quadrant IV’s population could also represent fruitful opportunities, but you will need to ask yourself, “at what cost?” If someone highly relevant to your job search has a low willingness to help, could you turn that person around? What would it take? Often, it’s best to funnel your energy and effort into the quadrants that will yield the best results: quadrants I and II.</p>

School clubs funnel information to their members about networking events, internships, and full-time opportunities.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Establish a relationship with career services</em>: Get involved with this group early on. People in career services have relationships with all the companies that come on campus to recruit. Check in with them in your freshman year and find out what opportunities exist and what the process is for applying.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Get to know your professors</em>: Professors are human beings, just like you. Ask them about their backgrounds and how they ended up teaching at your school. Ask what they like about it. You will be surprised at what you find out. Some professors will have worked in the business world and will have some good connections for you. You never know until you ask.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be curious about people and ask open-ended questions</em>: When meeting someone new, ask them questions like “How did you pick this school?” and <em class="emphasis">listen</em>. A good listener is so hard to find. Open-ended questions often yield a story (sometimes a compelling story), and you learn quite a bit about a person. Ask about their family relationships. Be genuine because it is wonderful to find out about people, and you never know who they know or who their extended family knows.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Meet as many different types of folks at school as possible</em>: Your school presents opportunities to meet people from all walks of life. Try to meet the president of the university, various administrators, deans (the dean of students is a great contact because that person manages the school clubs), professors, teaching assistants, fellow students, cafeteria workers, the hot dog vendor on the corner, the stationary store owner and clerks, the workers at your favorite coffee shop, security, library staff, and so on. Get to know these folks by (a) being polite and pleasant, (b) being responsible, and (c) recognizing them and knowing them by name. Even if your new acquaintances don’t further your networking objectives, perhaps some will become friends and make your stay at school all the better!</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Keep in touch with your old high school friends</em>: Your high school friends are likely at different schools, but it’s important to maintain contact. Your network will only grow this way, and you will enjoy continuing your friendships.</li>

                <li>Effective networkers build their network every chance they get. This includes networking with individuals they meet daily, at business events, and at social events of all kinds.</li>
                <li>Proactively build your network during your job search. Rather than go to lunch alone, see such outings as networking possibilities. Participate in as many events as you can and meet as many individuals as you can.</li>
                <li>The most helpful individuals to meet are those who are highly relevant to your job search and very willing to help.</li>
                <li>Many strategies exist for meeting people, even if you are shy. Observe people who network well and learn from their behavior. Pair up with someone who is a natural networker and learn from their interactions. Do not take things personally.</li>
                <li>You can ask many simple networking questions that will elicit substantial information from networking contacts.</li>
                <li>On-campus contacts can be found in every corner of your college or university. Take advantage of school clubs, meet as many administrators as possible, and remember that professors are people, too, and often have had careers in business.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p01">Your network should include people at all levels: your family and friends, past peers, and past managers. Follow these three suggestions to include senior people at all different levels into your network:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Participate in cross-functional task forces in any kind of work or educational situation. You will meet people at varying management levels and also get the chance to impress them and include them in your network.</li>
            <li>Contact senior managers and thank them or compliment them on their presentation or speech at any other formal meeting. Mention something specific about what they said, especially if it helped you in some way (it increased your knowledge, made you think differently about something, gave you an idea to solve a problem, and so forth), so they know you listened and they know your comment is genuine. Continue to follow up with them in other ways (holidays, congratulate them should they get promoted, and so forth).</li>
            <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mentor</a><span class="glossdef">A wise and trusted counselor.</span></span> can give you perspective that is very objective and, in some cases, powerful.

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Network with Recruiters</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p01">Many job seekers feel uneasy about keeping in touch with recruiters and feel like they are being a pest. However, recruiters appreciate candidates who stay in touch, as long as it’s in an unassuming way. For example, candidates should let recruiters know the latest news about them and their market, but shouldn’t include a request or a need with that news.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p02">Industry professionals offer the following networking advice regarding how job seekers can stay in touch:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Build the relationship before you need anything</em>. Xavier Roux, a partner at Redseeds Consulting, an executive search firm for management consulting, advises, “Strong candidates cultivate good relationships with recruiters when they are <em class="emphasis">not</em> looking for a job so that they can get help when they are.”</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t be afraid to follow up about a specific position that interests you</em>. AndrewHendricksen , a managing partner with OP/HR Group, an executive search firm focusing on technology and new media advises, “If you are very qualified you should feel comfortable making one to two cold or follow-up calls no matter what stage you are in the process, but keep in mind too many will result in your being disqualified.…[Send] a follow-up action plan once you understand a hiring manager’s expectations. This works especially well for people in sales and marketing or any job that requires results. If you are considered a top prospect, sending a high-level yet well-thought-out 90-day action plan can put you above your competition.”</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Contact people via social media after you have done the research and are fully prepared</em>. Jennifer Sobel, a recruitment manager at Disney ABC Television Group advises, “Many job seekers are desperately trying to use social networking tools to search for jobs, which is a great idea. However, they are using the tools all wrong. I must get ten to fifteen ‘LinkedIn’ requests per day from people searching for a job at my company. Their requests usually sound something like this: ‘Hi, I don’t know you but would love to work at your company. Are there any openings for me?’ I would urge each job seeker to only reach out when they have identified an open position that they meet the minimum qualifications for.…Not having your research done beforehand comes off as lazy and it doesn’t give a recruiter any reason to help you.”</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Remember that being helpful is a two-way exchange</em>. Sarah Grayson, a founding partner of On-Ramps, an executive search for the social sector, advises, “It’s always impressive to me when candidates refer us other strong candidates and go out of their way to stay in touch.…It shows me that they know how to network and value relationships.”</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_l02">
                <li>Many opportunities exist to meet senior people and include them in your network. When they speak to a large group, you can send them an e-mail thanking them if you learned something from what they said.</li>
                <li>Mentors are a key part of your network. You should have constant interaction with them throughout your college and work career.</li>

                <li>The next time you participate in a senior-level presentation of any kind, write the presenter an e-mail or a note thanking them for their speech or presentation. Mention something specific that you learned.</li>
                <li>If you have a mentor, create a schedule (every five to seven weeks) to touch base with them, inform them of your job search, or see what is happening with their career. If you don’t have a mentor, think about who you would like to have as a mentor. Approach that person and simply ask if they could mentor you, and set up a time to talk with them. Remember that it’s the mentee’s responsibility to maintain the relationship. Such a relationship is one of give and take, and emphasizing the give makes the relationship stronger and more fruitful.</li>

Now, this phrase pertains to the radical transparency you experience by using social networking sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p02">Facebook was started as a tool for college students, but companies started to enter this space in the 1990s. Companies, namely recruiters, started looking at Facebook pages and MySpace accounts when considering candidates for open positions. In fact, 40 percent or more of college admissions counselors reviewed Facebook pages before admitting candidates to their colleges and 40 percent of those who looked were not impressed by what they saw. Employers now review Facebook accounts before making hiring decisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p03">A word of caution to all: Ensure your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">digital dirt</a><span class="glossdef">Any unflattering personal information in cyberspace.</span></span> is cleaned up.

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_p01">A high majority of recruiters use online social networks, such as LinkedIn, to find candidates, so job seekers absolutely need to take advantage of these tools.

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s04_p01">A thorough job search encompasses many different activities, including research, expanding your network, following up with your existing network, updating your contact database, troubleshooting your search, and more. Online networking is helpful for research, networking, and maintaining contact information, so it’s worth a substantive time commitment, but not all of your time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Offline Networking Etiquette Still Applies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s05_p01">The most successful online networkers share much in common with successful offline networkers. You can do several things to match their success. Be respectful of people’s time. Write engaging (and grammatically correct) business communications. Ask intelligent questions. Focus on giving and helping others. Remember that online social media is one tool in the broad umbrella of networking, and common sense networking etiquette still applies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s06">

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s06_p01">LinkedIn and Facebook are referred to as social networking, so most job seekers use them primarily or even exclusively as networking tools. However, social networks are valuable at every stage of the job search, not just networking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Networks Help with Target Identification</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s07_p01">Use the detailed profiles in LinkedIn to get a better understanding of different job functions and career paths. If you think you want to work in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">corporate philanthropy</a><span class="glossdef">A department within a corporate that focuses on giving back to the community.</span></span>, find people who have these jobs and review their experience, skills, and projects. Use what you learn as a guide to what you might need in your career, or at least as good issues to research.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Research Companies and Industries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s08_p01">Again using the profile data, pay attention to how people talk about their work. Projects on which people are working hold invaluable clues to deciphering exactly what a company does, especially when it’s a small, privately held company with little published information about clients or projects. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Group discussions</a><span class="glossdef">Occur between group members on LinkedIn.com.</span></span> are another way to get a sense for a company or industry. Find a company alumni group or industry niche and follow the discussions or ask questions.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Gather Salary Data</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s05_s09_p01">Use the Q&amp;A function or specific group discussions on LinkedIn to collect data on salary, lifestyle, growth prospects, and other useful information for your own offer negotiation. Many geographies and industries are represented on online social networks, so you can specify exactly what you are looking for and likely find a close proxy.</p>

                <li>Social networking sites are great networking tools, but they have many other uses as well.

<span class="title-prefix">7.7</span> Chapter Review and Exercises</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p01">We know the importance of networking. For job searches and career advancement, networking enables you to hear about unadvertised jobs or plum projects that could propel your career forward. A strong network is also beneficial for day-to-day personal needs—finding a good doctor, checking on a contractor, discovering a good place for Mexican food.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p02">How do you know your network is strong enough to support you professionally and personally? Every few months, you should test the strength of your network:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p03">For example, if there is a position open at Pfizer and you think you would be a very strong fit for that position, is there someone in your network that you can contact that may lead you to someone within that company? It could be someone at Pfizer or at a company that recently merged with Pfizer. It could even be a competitor to Pfizer, as competitors often know and network with each other. Testing your network is a wise thing to do because you can then strengthen it proactively.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p04">If you have fewer than twenty-five strong professional contacts you could reach out to now, your network is too small. If you have deep, quality connections with a small number, this is a good start, but you also need quantity in your network. Make it a priority to meet new professional contacts. If you have the quality and the quantity, but you don’t feel like you could reach out today, then you have an issue with maintaining your network. Make it a priority to follow up with people you already know. As a bonus test, ask yourself how many people you could contact for personal needs. Look at the quantity but also the variety in your personal network.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p05">When was the last time you had lunch or a cup of coffee with a contact other than your day-to-day colleagues or closest friends? If it is has been more than a month or you cannot remember, this is a danger sign that your networking is too <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insular</a><span class="glossdef">Narrow or isolated.</span></span>. You are not exposing yourself to diverse perspectives. Remember the preceding point about how important it is to maintain your network. Earmarking some lunch hours for your networking contacts is a great way to follow up with your network.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p06">Mentors can be a tremendous help when you need to network. When you need some off-the-record advice or candid feedback, do you have people you can query who understand your role, your company, and your industry? If not, then you are not taking advantage of mentorship in your career. Mentors are more than senior people who can move you to the next level by sheer influence, although such a powerful type of mentor can have a place in your career. Mentors can also be your peers and often are colleagues who have an insight you don’t have and are willing to share it with you. Maybe they have been at the company longer and have a great sense of the politics; maybe they are superstrong presenters and can be your practice audience before you have a big meeting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p07">Networking isn’t something you can cram into last-minute efforts. A strong network is built over time and with deliberate attention to the quantity and quality of the contacts.  Audit your network on a regular basis (set Outlook to remind your quarterly) so that you consciously tend to your network before you face a crisis situation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch07_s07_p08">No one likes a person who reaches out only when they need something. No one wants to be the person who needs something, but feels all alone. Build a strong network so that you can make requests without imposing. Build a strong network so you don’t have to go it alone.</p>
