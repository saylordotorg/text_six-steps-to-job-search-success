    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_p01">Is it worth writing a cover letter knowing it might never be read? The short answer is yes. Some recruiters don’t read cover letters and go straight to the résumé, but other recruiters read and carefully weigh the information in cover letters. You don’t know which recruiter will receive your résumé and letter, so write the best cover letter you can. A well-written cover letter is an opportunity to present yourself well and influence a recruiter, so always take full advantage of that opportunity. A cover letter can also be viewed as your first conversation with a future employer, so be certain its quality is exceptional.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_p02">Your cover letter should be engaging, informative, and show your command of the written word. It should flow easily from a reader’s perspective, making the connection between the opportunity and your ability to succeed if given the chance. The tone should be compelling. You should be excited about the opportunity and you should be confident of your ability to succeed (even if you truly lack the confidence).</p>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Cover Letter Preliminary Work</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Preparation and practice are critical to every step of the job search process, and the cover letter is no different. Five actions can help make your cover letter compelling:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Make a list of your top ten strengths.</li>
            <li>Make a list of your top five weaknesses (also known as areas you’d like to strengthen).</li>
            <li>Decipher the job description to identify each separate skill and qualification.</li>
            <li>Compare the two lists to see if they are in alignment. Also identify the gaps—does the job description list something that you haven’t done?</li>
            <li>Highlight your top three skills that align with the job description as you will use them in your cover letter.</li>

                <li>Employers know it takes a certain level of maturity to talk about your weaknesses. They want to ensure you have achieved that level of maturity before extending an offer.</li>
                <li>Your weaknesses should in no way contain a hint of the skills necessary to excel at your target position. Your weaknesses should in no way contain a hint of the skills necessary to excel at any position.</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>You are aware that public speaking is a weakness, yet you‘ve already given presentations, are not an abysmal failure in this area, and have already achieved some success.</li>
                <li>You quantified where you are on a scale of one to ten and consider yourself a six. You have shown that you know the topic well, but haven’t yet mastered it. You mention two important aspects to being a good presenter: (1) you do best when you are prepared and (2) rehearsal and practice help you as well.</li>
                <li>You already have a plan to strengthen this skill: (1) you will take a public speaking class, (2) you are raising your hand as much as possible in class (which is a form of public speaking), (3) you are volunteering to present whenever you can, and (4) you are reading a book about presenting and it’s already helped.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p06">In addition, it’s important to note that a weakness should never be a core component of the job. For example, if you perceive your weakness to be public speaking, you wouldn’t apply for a position as a trainer. If you perceive your weakness to be analytical skills, you wouldn’t apply for a position as an accountant. A weakness can be a part of a job, for example, if you are applying for a position as an accountant, you would predominately do financial work and only sometimes present (e.g., share your findings with management), so using public speaking as a weakness in this case is fine.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s03_s01_p01">Consider the preceding sample. Study each component of the job description and how it relates to your skills so you can apply for and gain an interview for the position:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>Eight items are listed in the requirements section. Do your skills match all of these requirements, or the vast majority of them? It would be wise to compare this list to your list of strengths.</li>
                <li>An additional three requirements are not stated as obviously: (1) individuals must be motivated, (2) they must have the ability to master the work, and (3) they must have a desire to be a part of the sales team in order to be promoted. These requirements are found in the first section of the job description.</li>
                <li>Don’t count out the opportunity if you don’t fit every requirement. Do your best to think of something that is somewhat related. For example, if you have never worked in a fast-paced sales environment, focus on your desire to learn. Focus on the fact that you’ve observed fast-paced sales environments, and those situations appeal to you. At the very least, you could think of the fact that although you don’t have direct experience in that particular environment, you have always been very proactive in completing tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible.</li>
                <li>If you are a strong match for the majority of the requirements, ensure you have specific, results-oriented examples to demonstrate these skills.</li>
                <li>You will not have a clear indication as to which skills are more important than others, so use your best judgment call. Treat each skill as if it’s the most important. For example, consider communication skills—have a specific, results-oriented example of your verbal skills and your written skills. At some point, however, you will want to select the three skills you think are most important, match them to your strongest skills, and then write your cover letter.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p01">If you have examples of your expertise in a particular discipline, consider creating a portfolio of that information to share with potential employers. For example, perhaps you are a communications major and have written several documents that showcase your talent in this area. Include five or six samples of your communications to help build the case for why you should be hired. Perhaps you are a graphic design candidate, and you created several visuals that were used by neighborhood businesses, or for a class project. Include those visuals in a portfolio to help prove your talent to a future employer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_p02">How would you share this information with future employers? You can either attach your samples, along with your résumé and cover letter, in your e-mail to a future employer, or bring them with you when you have secured an interview. Either method is an acceptable way to impress a future employer. A portfolio that you can carry to an interview could simply be a neat and professional-looking folder that contains hard copies of your work. Or you can include a virtual portfolio of online work with a link an employer can use to view your samples. You can include this information in a cover letter and you can also include it in a résumé. Either way, having samples and presenting them can prove to future employers that you have the talent to succeed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s05_s01_p01">Formatting is important and must be neat and professional. It’s recommended that you flush all text to the left, as various software programs can wreak havoc with indentations and tabs.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s01_s05_s02_p01">Put extra effort into identifying the name of the hiring manager, so that your letter can be appropriately addressed to the specific person who will be reviewing résumés. Employers do not make this an easy step for you, and you have to do your research. Helpful exercises include researching the company website, reading news releases, and even calling the company to ask. Laziness will hurt your job search effort if this special effort is not made. If, after doing all the preceding, you still do not know the name of the person to whom you are sending your information, by all means, address it using Dear Hiring Manager or Dear Recruiter.</p>
