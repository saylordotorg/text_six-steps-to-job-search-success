        <h2 class="title editable block">Personal Finances Impact Career Success</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_p01">Some employers check credit history before extending offers. One of the reasons for this is the notion that a person’s ability to handle money responsibly is a signal of overall responsibility. This is a well-defined example of how your life outside of work (in this case, your finances) impacts your career success. When you transition to your first job, you have a number of financial issues to manage:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>If you borrowed money for school, you may have to start loan repayment.</li>
            <li>You may need to secure your first off-campus residence.</li>
            <li>You won’t have health insurance through your school, so you need to secure medical coverage.</li>
            <li>You have your first significant paycheck and need to understand <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">withholdings</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of taxes set aside from your paycheck and sent to the IRS as prepayment for your taxes.</span></span>, taxes, and perhaps <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">retirement plans</a><span class="glossdef">Financial structures set up so employers or employees can set aside money for retirement. Examples of retirement plans include IRA and 401k plans.</span></span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_p02">Even if this isn’t your first job, financial transitions will occur throughout your life—for example, buying a home, getting married and commingling finances and legal obligations, and having children.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_p03">For both the entry-level and the experienced worker, your financial situation dictates how much risk you can take, which may limit your opportunities. If you are living paycheck to paycheck, you might need to tolerate a less-than-ideal work situation. You might not be able to take a chance on a new business or a job change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_p04">Personal finances matter. You can start some good habits start early in your career:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s01_l02">
            <li>Check your credit annually. You can get a free credit report at each of the major credit bureaus at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp">https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp</a>.</li>
            <li>Manage your debt. If you have student loans, get confirmation about when you need to start repaying and how much. With other debts, make sure you pay at least the minimum on time. Late fees and penalties for underpayment can add significant amounts quickly to your original debt. Don’t forget to consider future graduate school plans as you review and organize your debt load.</li>
            <li>Get adequate insurance coverage. You want to be able to focus on your career and not have to worry about unexpected medical bills or something happening to your home derailing your focus. Types of insurance that most people need include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">medical insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Reimburses you financially for medical care, sometimes including preventive care, but especially care due to illness and hospitalization.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dental insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Reimburses you financially for dental treatments.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">life insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Reimburses a person or people you designate in the event that you die.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">homeowners or renters insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Reimburses you for loss or damage to your home or apartment; also typically includes coverage for the contents of your residence.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">disability insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Replaces a portion of your income if you are unable to work due to becoming disabled.</span></span>
</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Health and Well-Being Are Important to Your Career</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s02_p01">In addition to good finances, good health is part of the foundation for career success. You physically can’t do the work if you don’t take care of your health. Once you know your typical work schedule in your new job, schedule time for exercise. Some workplaces have gyms, or you might look at nearby gyms as an option to make time for exercise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s02_p02">Schedule your annual physical, dental appointments, and other routine medical care. Put these appointments into your professional calendar so you don’t schedule meetings on top of these and push them off to the side. Try scheduling as many routine checkups as possible before you start your job so that you can focus 100 percent on the new job.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s02_p03">Make time for breaks, eat lunch, drink water, and practice good health habits even during the workday. When you are new, you have a lot of information to process and you may be tempted to work through breaks or lunch, or never leave your desk. Set your Outlook calendar to remind you to stretch. Block off your lunch hours and make dates with colleagues so you keep the time free. You need to replenish your mental and physical energy so you are able to focus and do good work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s02_p04">You might be tempted to work past the regular day, or do career-related activities after work (e.g., professional networking, training). While this is admirable, you also want to pursue hobbies and personal interests outside work. First of all, personal hobbies make you a more well-rounded person, which helps your career. Second, focusing on personal hobbies gives you a more diverse network, which also helps your career. Finally, pursuing personal interests gives you a much-needed mental break, which should help you be more focused and possibly more creative in your job.</p>

    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Personal Relationships also Need Attention</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch12_s06_s03_p01">Not every relationship needs to contribute to your career success. Consider involvement in your community. Don’t forget your social circle from college and other non-work-related situations. Similar to personal hobbies, personal relationships outside work make you more well rounded and give you a diverse perspective. It is easy to overlook these relationships, so schedule time on your calendar on an ongoing basis so that these relationships are not continually pushed aside for work reasons.</p>

                <li>Itemize your current financial responsibilities. Make a list of bills you need to pay. Make a list of action steps before your next job, for example, if you need to find a place to live. Check your insurance coverage.</li>
                <li>Schedule routine medical checkups. Set your calendar for when you need to make your next appointment so that when you are busy on the job you can be assured that your calendar will remind you to make appointments.</li>
                <li>Pick which personal hobbies and relationships you will prioritize. Make specific plans with dates, times, and activities and how you will incorporate these interests and relationships once you start working.</li>
