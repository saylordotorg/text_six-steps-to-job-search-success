    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p05">Why you look for a job also influences the constraints you face when you look:</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Timing and deadlines</strong>. On one extreme, you have the internship search with a tight, inflexible time frame. If you need an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">internship for credit</a><span class="glossdef">Internship where you are receiving school credit in exchange for performing the internship. The credit is usually in lieu of receiving a wage.</span></span> next semester, you either get the job by the time of registration or do not. You may need to relocate by a certain date. Your savings may be running out, so you may need to return to the workforce within a definite timetable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p07">On the other hand, you may have a job that is secure, so you can take your time with your search. You may be an ambitious freshman or sophomore with several years before you graduate and need that full-time job.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Access to resources</strong>. When you are in school, you most likely have a dedicated career services office. If you have graduated and have been out of the workforce for some time, you may have little contact with a professional network or support system. You can join an industry association, participate in networking groups, or hire a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">career coach</a><span class="glossdef">Someone who works with you on your job search. Typical activities include helping you select appropriate jobs and careers to pursue, helping with résumés and other marketing, practicing interviewing and networking, and keeping the search on track.</span></span> to help you create that professional network and support system. Your options for job search support will be different depending on where you live and how much you can invest in your search. People in busy urban areas can more easily find a chapter of a professional organization that matches their interests, like-minded people with whom to network, and career coaches and other professional support resources for hire. In a less-populated geography, you may have to rely on virtual access to professional organizations, networks, and resources. Similarly, your level of financial investment dictates which and how many organizations and networks you can join and what outside resources you can hire. Free or low-cost guidance is available from alumni associations, government agencies focused on workforce issues, and online job boards or career sites that offer guidance and expertise.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch01_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">Emotional constraints</strong>. Certain industries, such as banking and consulting, have very regimented and competitive campus recruiting seasons. Pressure is high as soon as you hit the campus. Someone returning to the workforce after a gap may feel more anxiety or fear than a job seeker with continuous employment. A career changer may feel frustrated at having to break through to a new industry or function. <a class="xref" href="#ceniza_1.0-ch01_t02">Table 1.2 "Job Search Considerations"</a> summarizes each of these considerations as it applies both to students and experienced candidates.</p>

<p class="para">Your savings may dictate that you find a summer job, versus an internship, especially if that internship is nonpaid (you may or may not receive school credit)</p>
<p class="para">On the other hand, you may be a student who has a financial cushion, and you need not rush into a job just for the compensation it provides</p>
</td>
                    <td>
<p class="para">When reentering the workforce, having as few gaps as possible is helpful and requires less explaining and messaging</p>
<p class="para">Relocating adds time to a job search, in addition to expense. Traveling to the desired location is both time consuming and expensive</p>
<p class="para">Savings may dictate the length of your search and when timing is tight, you may have fewer options to consider</p>

<p class="para">Other industries are more flexible and hire throughout the year (e.g., media, communications, technology), but there is still the pressure of networking events, interviews, and follow-ups</p>
<p class="para">Some industries (e.g., education, health care) may not come on campus at all, so you would have to manage the entire calendar yourself</p>
</td>
                    <td>
<p class="para">When seeking to reenter the workforce, you need to craft a message to explain timing and reasons, which can sometimes be emotional. Harnessing emotion can help develop rapport but it also needs to be balanced with remaining professional</p>
