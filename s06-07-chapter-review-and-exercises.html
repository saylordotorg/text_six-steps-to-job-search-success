    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s07_p01">The six-step job search process provides a constant structure that works for a variety of life situations, including students looking for an internship or full-time job, career changers, people relocating for work, or people coming back to work after unemployment or a leave of absence. The steps are designed to give you a framework to follow and keep the job search process from becoming overwhelming. But the framework is not fixed, so you should expect to revisit the steps as needed to refine and adjust your search along the way.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s07_p02">In addition to the six steps of the job search, you need to have a foundation in place for job search success, including confidence you can get a job, strong communication skills, poise and professional presence, and the physical resources to support your search. You also should be aware of trends in the job market, including 24/7 communication capability that encourages people to overwork, an entrepreneurial approach to the job search that translates the business techniques of branding, marketing, and sales to the individual, and the multigenerational workplace. We have four generations active in the workplace, so the probability of dealing with someone much older or younger than you is significant. Do not assume that people have the same expectations and behaviors as you, and focus instead on building rapport individual by individual.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Chapter Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch02_s07_l01">
            <li>The six steps of the job search are sequential because one step leads into the next.</li>
            <li>It is helpful to follow the sequence so you are not overwhelmed by doing everything at once and so you can build a progression.</li>
            <li>The six steps of the job search are concurrent because each step influences the others.</li>
            <li>It is helpful to allow the six steps to overlap so you can use the information and feedback from each step to strengthen and refine the others.</li>
            <li>The six-step process assumes you have some fundamental skills and resources in place, including confidence, communication skills, poise, and physical resources.</li>
            <li>A confident job seeker knows he or she will get a job.</li>
            <li>A confident job seeker is excited at the prospect of working and getting a job he or she wants.</li>

            <li>You can improve your communication skills by focusing on them now and practicing good communication habits.</li>
            <li>Poise refers to professional dress, carriage, appropriate body language, and nonverbal communication skills. Poise is critical to the job search.</li>
            <li>Good poise complements and supports the other good job search fundamentals, while lack of poise detracts from them.</li>
            <li>Prepare and practice now to incorporate poise into your regular behavior.</li>
            <li>Your job search requires time, space, and money resources.</li>
            <li>You need to allocate these resources to your search and decide on the trade-offs necessary to spend your time, space, and money on your search, as opposed to other objectives.</li>
            <li>Line up your resources before your job search so that you create an environment that supports your job search.</li>
            <li>The current job market is characterized by 24/7 activity, increased entrepreneurship, and a multigenerational workforce.</li>
            <li>Savvy job seekers can incorporate these trends into their job search to increase their value over the competition.</li>
