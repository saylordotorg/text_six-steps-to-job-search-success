<span class="title-prefix">9.4</span> How to Create Systems to Stay Organized</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_l01">
            <li>Learn why systems are important to getting and staying organized.</li>
            <li>Get ideas for different organizational systems.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_p01">Systems are essential to getting and staying organized. By selecting a system, you ensure that your current lists get organized but also that any additional items to your list get organized. A system enables you to make updates and changes to your contacts or activities. A good system enables you to find what you need quickly so you can track your job search and move forward.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_p02">The most important criterion for selecting your organizational system is that it supports you and how you work best. You do not want to create or select a high-maintenance system that requires big changes in your natural work style and, therefore, a lot of additional work. Your job search will give you enough to do without having to add extra time and effort tracking the information.</p>
    <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Systems for Your Overall Contact List</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Some popular methods of storing your overall contacts include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Paper address book</li>
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rolodex</a><span class="glossdef">A popular circular device that stores physical business cards in an alphabetized wheel that you can turn to access each card.</span></span> or business card collection</li>
            <li>Cell phone directory</li>
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Outlook</a><span class="glossdef">A Microsoft software program commonly used for e-mail that also has organizational features, including address book, distribution list, calendar, to-do list, notes, reminders, and other features.</span></span> or other e-mail contacts database</li>
            <li>Facebook, LinkedIn, or other <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social media network</a><span class="glossdef">An online community where members of that community can connect to and communicate with each other.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Relationship management system, such as SuccessHawk for job search or Salesforce for sales leads</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p02">For many people, the overall contact system is some combination of the preceding methods. The important thing is that the system supports you. There are ways you will know your system works:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_l02">
            <li>You can easily find the people you need.</li>
            <li>Information on your contacts is updated or easy to update.</li>
            <li>You can easily skim or search your contacts to discover people you might have forgotten.</li>
            <li>You can categorize people so that your network stays organized as it grows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Systems for Your Job Search–Specific List</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p01">For your job search–specific list, you need a system that can capture both contact information and activity. So it needs to be more flexible and substantive than your overall contact system. You can choose from three categories of systems for your job search–specific list:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Paper based</li>
            <li>Customized electronic</li>
            <li>Off-the-shelf electronic</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Paper-Based Job Search–Specific Systems</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p01">In a paper-based system, you have a tabbed binder or accordion file folder, with different sections corresponding to different areas of your search. You can have a section for each target company, as well as for your overall search. You can also have a separate sheet for each person related to each target company and log your activity with that person there.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p02">A paper system has several positive traits:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>It is visual.</li>
                <li>It enables you to easily capture thoughts, ideas, and asides</li>
                <li>It is easily portable, so you don’t have to carry a laptop or find an Internet connection</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p03">A paper system does have some downsides:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_l02">
                <li>It is difficult to search. What if your research turns up a name for a senior executive at one of your dream companies, who happens to be an alumnus of your school? You don’t want to contact him right away because you want to do some other lower-level <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informational interviews</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting set up with the purpose of gathering information or exploring a topic.</span></span> first. Several weeks later, you know you want to go back to this contact, but what was his name? You would have to page through your whole paper system to find it.</li>
                <li>It is hard to back up.</li>
                <li>It consumes more space when you have a lot of leads.</li>
                <li>It lacks flexibility. If you arranged your filing by company, where do you put your general networking contacts or other people who may be relevant across companies?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s02_p02">You can add additional columns as needed for fields you want to track.  For example, you may want to include a Comments column and put notes or ideas there. As you add more contacts, sort by status date to see to whom you haven’t reached out recently. Then check the follow-up column to see if you need to do something specific or just reach out to maintain the relationship. The First Contact field shows the first time you reached out to this person, so you can see if you have moved forward since adding them to the list. In the case of Jane Doe, you attempted to contact her on September 1 and you are still trying to reach her for an informational interview on October 1. You need to try harder to reach her, or assume the contact is stale and find someone else to add to your list.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s03_p01">Salespeople use customer relationship management (CRM) software, such as Salesforce or High Rise, to track candidates and activity. In the job search, you are the product and employers are the customers, so you can apply the idea of sales-tracking software to your job search. One solution already customized to the job search is SuccessHawk Job Search Productivity Solutions.</p>

You can import your contacts from your existing overall lists. SuccessHawk supports online e-mail (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, and so forth), LinkedIn, Outlook, Apple Address Book, vCards, and Internet service provider webmail (e.g., Comcast).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s03_p03">SuccessHawk also has a section for tasks, where you can export tasks from Apple calendar or Outlook, or you can add tasks manually. So instead of documenting in Excel that you want to call Jane Doe for an informational interview, you would Add a Task to your SuccessHawk “My Action Items” section, designating the target (Jane Doe), a description of the task (call to follow up on e-mail request for informational interview), and a target due date. SuccessHawk sends you e-mail reminders of upcoming tasks, so instead of having to visit your Excel spreadsheet and sort by follow-up, the reminders come to you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s03_p04">SuccessHawk also has other job search-related features built into the platform, including a space for goals, a résumé creator, and advice and research.</p>
