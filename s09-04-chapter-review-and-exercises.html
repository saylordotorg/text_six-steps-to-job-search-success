    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_p01">Creating a compelling marketing campaign is a vital step in your job search because it markets your skills and abilities to future employers, in most cases, before you meet them. The four components of this step are the following:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_l01">
        <li>Creating a résumé</li>
        <li>Writing a cover letter</li>
        <li>Creating an online profile</li>
        <li>Composing a pitch</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_p02">Your marketing campaign will be more effective when you are more specific, targeted, and thoughtful of how to construct your marketing campaign elements:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_l02">
        <li>Your résumé will prove your success with your past employers, which then proves your worth to your future employers.</li>
        <li>Your cover letter makes the case for why you should be hired because it highlights the two or three critical skills necessary to succeed in the job you are seeking.</li>
        <li>Your online profile works behind the scenes to ensure you are seen by recruiters who seek talent. In addition, your profile provides a great way to stay connected with your network.</li>
        <li>Your pitch allows you to introduce yourself in a clear and concise way, highlighting the strengths you have that will enable you to succeed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_p03">Remember that the better you market yourself, the more successful your job search will be. Apple’s marketing campaign leaves no doubt about the quality of what they offer. You should do the exact same!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_p04">The next step, step 3, is research, which will help you gather vast amounts of information about your industry, your function, your geography, and the companies you are targeting.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Chapter Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="ceniza_1.0-ch05_s04_l03">
            <li>Creating a compelling marketing campaign is vital to your job search and is composed of four things: a résumé, a cover letter, an online profile, and a pitch.</li>
            <li>Your marketing campaign must have high-quality standards because it represents you when you are not there.</li>
            <li>Even though some recruiters do not read cover letters, it is always worthwhile to write a compelling cover letter, just in case the recruiter who reviews your information values them.</li>
            <li>You should do five things before writing a cover letter: (1) assess your strengths, (2) assess your weaknesses, (3) decipher the job description, (4) compare your strengths, weaknesses, and the job description for alignment, and (5) select the top three skills you will include in your cover letter.</li>
            <li>The cover letter template includes three sections: (1) the introductory paragraph, (2) the last paragraph, which reiterates your interest, and (3) the magic middle (which highlights your top three skills).</li>
            <li>Your online profile serves two functions: (1) it’s a passive job search strategy because recruiters search online profiles, and (2) it’s a great networking tool because you can connect with friends, family, former coworkers, and current schoolmates and stay in touch with them easily regardless of where you or they live or work.</li>
            <li>A pitch should be short (less than one minute), concise, and include the following: (1) your educational background, (2) any pertinent experience in the field in which you are interested, (3) your critical skills and strengths, (4) what you want to do, and (5) why you would be good at it.</li>
        </ul>
