    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p01">Control what you can control, and your interview will be more successful. This includes doing the following, but this list is far from exhaustive:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_l01">
        <li>Assess your strengths and weaknesses before the interview.</li>
        <li>Research the company and its competitors in advance of your meeting.</li>
        <li>Prepare and practice interview questions.</li>
        <li>Create a routine for the day of the interview to ensure you don’t rush or skip important steps.</li>
        <li>Write down five to seven questions to ask at the end of your interview to prove you are motivated to get this job offer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p02">Remember that interviews are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subjective</a><span class="glossdef">An interviewer can make up their mind based on nonscientific data. They can have a preconceived notion of you as a candidate that has nothing to do with your strengths.</span></span> and that a second interview is never a guarantee. Budgets can shift and your targeted company may have to pull an open requisition. Perhaps the company wants to promote from within and they may hire an internal candidate. Many interviewers hire in their own image, regardless of any interviewer training course they may attend. No matter what happens at the end of your interview, it’s important to stay positive and it’s equally important to not take it personally.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p03">Regardless of the interview’s outcome, and especially if you don’t get the job, thank the interviewer for the interaction. Continue to keep in touch because that person can become an important part of your network. Leaving a positive impression can only help your future prospects because jobs for which you would be a perfect fit might open in the near term. Remember also that recruiters and hiring managers tend to move from company to company, and there is a strong likelihood that your paths may cross again. Maintaining positive relationships can only help your career.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="ceniza_1.0-ch08_s06_p04">Lastly, if you interview for a position and you don’t get it, at least appreciate the value and practice of your experience. Troubleshoot what could have gone better and improve on that one thing. If you are proactive enough at strengthening your interview ability and ensuring you have enough interviews lined up, you increase your chances of getting a job offer. Once that happens, you will probably be in the interviewer’s seat before long.</p>
